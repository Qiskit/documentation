  # Three event types can trigger this workflow:
  #  1. Pull request (opened, synchronize)
  #     On creating or pushing to a PR branch, this action runs any changed
  #     notebooks and reports pass / fail. This is to catch broken code
  #     examples.
  #  2. Pull request (labeled)
  #     On adding the `🤖 Auto execute` label (id: 6409509633) to a PR, this
  #     workflow executes any changed notebooks, then pushes the updates to the
  #     PR branch. This makes it easy to quickly get notebooks executed in the
  #     CI environment.
  #  3. Workflow dispatch
  #     When triggered by a workflow_dispatch event, we execute all notebooks,
  #     and make a PR to the branch with the updated notebooks. This is handy
  #     when upgrading qiskit package versions.
