# Tutorials


Use these tutorials to learn how to apply Qiskit to common quantum computing use cases.



- Start with the set of tutorials in the [Get started](#get-started) section if it is your first time running code on a quantum computer.

- The section on [workflows toward advantage](#explore-workflows-toward-advantage) contains end-to-end examples of using a quantum computer to solve real-world problems. These tutorials focus on algorithms that are promising candidates for achieving computational advantage by a quantum computer over a classical computer.

- The section on [Qiskit capabilities](#leverage-qiskit-capabilities) contains examples that use the latest and most advanced techniques in the Qiskit ecosystem to improve part or the whole of a particular workflow.



## Get started


These tutorials are for beginners who are ready to explore running quantum algorithms on a quantum computer.

## Explore workflows toward advantage


Tutorials in this section cover large-scale demonstrations of quantum algorithms.



The algorithms in this category focus on quantum circuits whose output distributions encode solutions to structured problems with verifiable output. Verifiability means that you can check the consistency between measured data, either through evaluating the chosen bitstring or by knowing that false positives do not occur.


The tutorials highlight techniques where repeated sampling enables estimation of problem-specific quantities (for example, cost function values or spectral weights). These methods are particularly relevant for optimization and simulation tasks with symmetries.

These tutorials focus on estimating physically meaningful quantities, such as energy or correlation values, by preparing quantum states and measuring observables. Techniques include both variational and Trotterized circuit approaches that balance circuit expressiveness with circuit-depth efficiency. Emphasis is placed on workflows that reduce quantum resource demands while maintaining accuracy, and enabling practical estimation of observables in chemical and physical systems.

This section features algorithms with well-defined theoretical guarantees that are designed to run on future error-corrected quantum hardware. The circuits or sampling overhead for these algorithms scale in a manner that is not depth-efficient and are thereby are more likely to demonstrate quantum advantage when fault-tolerant quantum computers exist. These tutorials illustrate how the methods operate in idealized settings and demonstrate small scale examples.
