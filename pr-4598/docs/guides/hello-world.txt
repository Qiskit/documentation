Such work requires computations to be done on a much larger scale; working with circuits that might use over 100 qubits and over 1000 gates. This example demonstrates how you can accomplish utility-scale work on IBM® QPUs by creating and analyzing a 100-qubit GHZ state.  It uses the Qiskit patterns workflow and ends by measuring the expectation value ",["$","span",null,{"className":"katex","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"katex-mathml","children":["$","math",null,{"xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML","children":["$","semantics",null,{"children":[["$","mrow",null,{"children":[["$","mo",null,{"stretchy":"false","children":"⟨"}],["$","msub",null,{"children":[["$","mi",null,{"children":"Z"}],["$","mn",null,{"children":"0"}]]}],["$","msub",null,{"children":[["$","mi",null,{"children":"Z"}],["$","mi",null,{"children":"i"}]]}],["$","mo",null,{"stretchy":"false","children":"⟩"}]]}],["$","annotation",null,{"encoding":"application/x-tex","children":"\\langle Z_0 Z_i \\rangle "}]]}]}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"katex-html","aria-hidden":"true","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"base","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"strut","style":{"height":"1em","verticalAlign":"-0.25em"}}],["$","span",null,{"className":"mopen","children":"⟨"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"mord","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"mord mathnormal","style":{"marginRight":"0.07153em"},"children":"Z"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"msupsub","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist-t vlist-t2","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist-r","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist","style":{"height":"0.3011em"},"children":["$","span",null,{"style":{"top":"-2.55em","marginLeft":"-0.0715em","marginRight":"0.05em"},"children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"pstrut","style":{"height":"2.7em"}}],["$","span",null,{"className":"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"mord mtight","children":"0"}]}]]}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist-s","children":"​"}]]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist-r","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist","style":{"height":"0.15em"},"children":["$","span",null,{}]}]}]]}]}]]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"mord","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"mord mathnormal","style":{"marginRight":"0.07153em"},"children":"Z"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"msupsub","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist-t vlist-t2","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist-r","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist","style":{"height":"0.3117em"},"children":["$","span",null,{"style":{"top":"-2.55em","marginLeft":"-0.0715em","marginRight":"0.05em"},"children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"pstrut","style":{"height":"2.7em"}}],["$","span",null,{"className":"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"mord mathnormal mtight","children":"i"}]}]]}]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist-s","children":"​"}]]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist-r","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"vlist","style":{"height":"0.15em"},"children":["$","span",null,{}]}]}]]}]}]]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"mclose","children":"⟩"}]]}]}]]}]," for each qubit."],"className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]
