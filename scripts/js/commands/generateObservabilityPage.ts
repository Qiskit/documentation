# Activity tracking events for Qiskit Runtime

IBM Cloud&reg; services, such as Qiskit Runtime, generate activity tracking events.

Activity tracking events report on activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. You can use the events to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements.

You can use IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing, a platform service, to route auditing events in your account to destinations of your choice by configuring targets and routes that define where activity tracking events are sent. For more information, see [About IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Events Routing.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-about)

You can use IBM Cloud Logs to visualize and alert on events that are generated in your account and routed by IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing to an IBM Cloud Logs instance.

## Locations where activity tracking events are generated

Qiskit Runtime sends activity tracking events in the following regions:

- Washington ("us-east")
- Frankfurt ("eu-de")

## Viewing activity tracking events for Qiskit Runtime

You can use IBM Cloud Logs to visualize and alert on events that are generated in your account and routed by IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing to an IBM Cloud Logs instance.

### Launching IBM Cloud Logs from the Observability page
