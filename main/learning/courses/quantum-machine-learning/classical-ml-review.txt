6b:T41c,For instance, CC means that we have a classical dataset – such as images, sound, or text that we can store on classical computers - and that we also use a classical computer to run a machine learning algorithm. This is precisely the classical machine learning setting. On the other hand, QQ means that we are using a quantum computer to process quantum data. Here, “quantum data” could mean several things, and could be context-dependent. Quantum data could be thought of as a set of measurement outcomes obtained from a quantum device, or it could refer to states that have been prepared on a quantum computer by another algorithm. In the future, it could even refer to data stored in QRAM (Quantum Random Access Memory), which does not currently exist. When researchers talk about quantum machine learning, they usually refer to the CQ regime, where the dataset at hand is classical and the processing device executing the machine learning algorithm is a quantum computer. In the following parts of the course, we will focus on such algorithms.27:["$","p",null,{"children":"$6b","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]

These non-linear activation functions are critical for the great expressive power of neural networks.
