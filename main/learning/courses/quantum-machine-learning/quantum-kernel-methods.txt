In other words, we need to map our data into the Hilbert space of states of our quantum computer. We do this by constructing a data-dependent circuit. There are many ways of doing this, and the previous lesson outlined a number of options. You can construct your own circuit to encode your data, or you can use a pre-made feature map like ",["$","code",null,{"children":"zz_feature_map","className":"text-code-02 inline px-4 bg-background border border-transparent dark:border-border-subtle-00 [overflow-wrap:anywhere] group-[.pre-el]:text-code-02 group-[.pre-el]:inline-block group-[.pre-el]:whitespace-pre group-[.pre-el]:p-12 group-[.pre-el]:pr-[50px] group-[.pre-el]:bg-inherit dark:group-[.pre-el]:border-transparent group-[.paragraph-el]:whitespace-normal"}],".
