Indeed, there are cases where structures borrowed from classical neural networks, such as convolution layers, play an important role in VQCs. In such cases where the analogy is strong, QNNs may be a useful description. But parameterized quantum circuits need not follow the general structure of a neural network; for example, not all data need to be loaded in the first (input) layer; we can load some data in the first layer, apply some gates and then load additional data (a process called data \"reuploading\"). We should therefore think of QNNs as a subset of parameterized quantum circuits, and we should not be limited in our exploration of useful quantum circuits by the analogy to classical neural networks.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}],"\n","$L1e","\n","$L1f","\n","$L20","\n","$L21","\n","$L22","\n","$L23","\n","$L24","\n","$L25","\n","$L26","\n","$L27","\n","$L28","\n","$L29","\n","$L2a","\n","$L2b","\n","$L2c","\n","$L2d","\n","$L2e","\n","$L2f","\n","$L30","\n","$L31","\n","$L32","\n","$L33","\n","$L34","\n","$L35","\n","$L36","\n","$L37","\n","$L38","\n","$L39","\n","$L3a","\n","$L3b","\n","$L3c","\n","$L3d","\n","$L3e","\n","$L3f","\n","$L40","\n","$L41","\n","$L42","\n","$L43","\n","$L44","\n","$L45","\n","$L46","\n","$L47","\n","$L48","\n","$L49","\n","$L4a","\n","$L4b","\n","$L4c","\n","$L4d","\n","$L4e","\n","$L4f","\n","$L50","\n","$L51","\n","$L52","\n","$L53","\n","$L54","\n","$L55","\n","$L56","\n","$L57","\n","$L58","\n","$L59","\n","$L5a","\n","$L5b","\n","$L5c","\n","$L5d","\n","$L5e","\n","$L5f","\n","$L60","\n","$L61","\n","$L62","\n","$L63","\n","$L64","\n","$L65","\n","$L66","\n","$L67","\n","$L68","\n","$L69","\n","$L6a","\n","$L6b","\n","$L6c","\n","$L6d","\n","$L6e","\n","$L6f","\n","$L70","\n","$L71","\n","$L72","\n","$L73","\n","$L74","\n","$L75","\n","$L76","\n","$L77","\n","$L78","\n","$L79","\n","$L7a","\n","$L7b","\n","$L7c","\n","$L7d","\n","$L7e","\n","$L7f","\n","$L80","\n","$L81","\n","$L82","\n","$L83","\n","$L84","\n","$L85","\n","$L86","\n","$L87","\n","$L88","\n","$L89","\n","$L8a","\n","$L8b","\n","$L8c","\n","$L8d","\n","$L8e","\n","$L8f","\n","$L90","\n","$L91","\n","$L92","\n","$L93","\n","$L94","\n","$L95","\n","$L96","\n","$L97","\n","$L98","\n","$L99","\n","$L9a","\n","$L9b","\n","$L9c","\n","$L9d","\n","$L9e","\n","$L9f","\n","$La0","\n","$La1","\n","$La2","\n","$La3","\n","$La4","\n","$La5","\n","$La6","\n","$La7","\n","$La8","\n","$La9","\n","$Laa","\n","$Lab","\n","$Lac","\n","$Lad","\n","$Lae","\n","$Laf","\n","$Lb0","\n","$Lb1","\n","$Lb2","\n","$Lb3","\n","$Lb4","\n","$Lb5","\n","$Lb6","\n","$Lb7","\n","$Lb8","\n","$Lb9","\n","$Lba","\n","$Lbb","\n","$Lbc","\n","$Lbd","\n","$Lbe","\n","$Lbf","\n","$Lc0","\n","$Lc1","\n","$Lc2","\n","$Lc3","\n","$Lc4","\n","$Lc5","\n","$Lc6","\n","$Lc7","\n","$Lc8","\n","$Lc9","\n","$Lca","\n","$Lcb","\n","$Lcc","\n","$Lcd","\n","$Lce","\n","$Lcf","\n","$Ld0","\n","$Ld1","\n","$Ld2","\n","$Ld3","\n","$Ld4","\n","$Ld5","\n","$Ld6","\n","$Ld7","\n","$Ld8","\n","$Ld9","\n","$Lda","\n","$Ldb","\n","$Ldc","\n","$Ldd","\n","$Lde","\n","$Ldf","\n","$Le0","\n","$Le1","\n","$Le2","\n","$Le3","\n","$Le4","\n","$Le5","\n","$Le6","\n","$Le7","\n","$Le8","\n","$Le9","\n","$Lea"],"$Leb"]}]}]]}],"$Lec"]}]
