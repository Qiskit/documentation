67:T4c1,Machine learning (ML) applies algorithms to data sets, and so QML might plausibly include quantum mechanics in either the data or algorithmic sides, or both. All of these possibilities are potentially interesting. But we will mostly restrict ourselves to discussions of quantum algorithms applied to classical data. One reason for this is that ML problems with classical data are already so well studied and widely available. There is broad interest in solving problems that start with classical data. Another reason is the lack of QRAM. Without the ability to store large amounts of quantum data on a relatively long timescale, methods that begin with quantum data are still fairly far from applicability to industry. It is also unclear how to "quantumly-access" classical data in an efficient manner. Two types of ML of particular interest are supervised learning, in which you train an algorithm using a labeled data set, and unsupervised learning, in which the algorithm attempts to learn about a distribution from unlabeled samples. An unsupervised algorithm might, for example, learn how to generate new samples from the same distribution, or how to cluster the samples into groups with similar characteristics.25:["$","p",null,{"children":"$67","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]

For the purposes of visualizing example clusters the algorithm might identify, the data points have now been labeled. A key difference between the two is that the supervised learning process starts with the data already labeled and the unsupervised process starts with unlabeled data, even if the data are labeled at the end.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]
28:["$","p",null,{"children":"Those with background in machine learning will already know that many solution methods involve mapping data into higher-dimensional spaces. This is especially well-explored in the context of kernels. As a brief reminder, sometimes data may be separable into categories by a line, plane, or hyperplane (we will often simply say \"hyperplane\" for compactness), in the same number of dimensions as the data are given. This is shown in the first image above. Other times, data may not be separable by a hyperplane in those dimensions, as shown in the second image. But there can still be structure to the data that can be exploited in a mapping to higher dimensions, which then leaves the data separable in that higher-dimensional space. This is illustrated in the mapping of the 2D data with circular symmetry into the 3D space in which the data points are arranged along a paraboloid surface.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]

In particular, we must address the nuance in dataset selection and the challenges in reaching utility scale.

So what we have done above is created a quantum circuit that contains the features of our two data points, and maps them into the space of a quantum vector, then estimates the inner product in that space via making measurements. This is an example of quantum kernel estimation. Note we only implemented this process for two of the data points (the 14th and 19th). If we did this for all possible pairs, we could take the output (in this case the number 0.821...) and populate a matrix of results describing the overlap between all points in the training data set.
