Setting or updating parameters is computationally easy; the difficulty there is in selecting useful, physically motivated initial parameters. Using accumulated information from prior iterations to update parameters in such a way that you approach the ground state is a non-trivial. But classical optimization algorithms exist that do this quite efficiently. This classical optimization is only expensive because it may require many iterations; in the worst case, the number of iterations may scale exponentially with N.
