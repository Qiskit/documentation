66:T4dd,Quantum computers provide a tool to look at these problems in a different way. Scientists continue to experiment with better algorithms to apply to these problems. In anticipation of commercial quantum computing, leading companies are identifying and testing use cases that generate in-house quantum capabilities. The more effectively designed a use case is, the more likely it will be to deliver business value. Take, for example, the use case of untangling operational disruption in airline schedules and staffing. This use case shows promise because it has the potential to offer a disruptive solution for a core business problem in the future; there is an existing, though sub-optimal, classical alternative; and quantum algorithms have already been shown to be effective in choosing the best scenarios in Monte Carlo simulations used in banking and finance. Strategic use cases such as this one attend to near-term technical feasibility; consider the potential for quantum computing technology to outperform classical alternatives; and assess the projected business impact, as determined by market outcomes, competitive consequences, and financial impact.
