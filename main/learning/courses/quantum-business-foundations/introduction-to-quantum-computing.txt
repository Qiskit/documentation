In 2007, a team at Yale found a way to combine some of these approaches to overcome their individual shortcomings, naming the new design the “transmon qubit.” The transmon qubit would go on to be at the heart of many companies’ efforts to develop quantum computers, including IBM Quantum, Google AI, and Rigetti Computing. A member of the Yale team, Jay Gambetta, later became Vice President of Quantum Computing for IBM Research.","className":"p-12 m-0 align-top [&_ul]:!my-0 [&_ul]:list-disc [&_ul]:list-inside [&_ol]:!my-0 [&_ol]:list-decimal [&_ol]:list-inside"}]],"className":"border-layer-02 border-b"}]
