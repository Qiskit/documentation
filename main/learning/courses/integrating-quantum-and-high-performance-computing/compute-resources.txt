a6:T456,Quantum computers do not have traditional memory, in the sense of persistent, addressable storage like RAM or GPU memory.Classical computing resources have discrete bits stored in memory, allowing data to be saved, fetched, and reused during computation. Quantum resources use qubits which do not store memory in the classical sense. Instead, qubits exist in quantum states that represent superpositions of 0 and 1 simultaneously, enabling exponential parallelism in state space. However, qubit states are fragile and cannot be cloned or read deterministically at intermediate steps without collapsing the quantum state, so persistent memory-like behavior during computation does not exist. Qubits must be maintained in a coherent state throughout execution, and the "memory" is essentially the quantum state itself. Classical memory can only be used alongside a quantum processor, not as internal quantum memory. This has significant implications: classical compute resources can reuse and store intermediate results freely; quantum resources cannot do this without measurements which disturb the computation.47:["$","p",null,{"children":"$a6","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]

a7:T46e,One step in resource estimation that is unique to quantum computing is the circuit depth. As mentioned earlier, each quantum gate and each delay time between operations comes with noise and a certain probability of an error. The deeper the quantum circuit, the greater the noise. There are two subtleties to this: two-qubit gates have much higher error rates than single-qubit gates, so one can often ignore the single-qubit depth. Further, not all qubits on a quantum chip are directly connected. Sometimes information has to be swapped from qubit to qubit in order to perform the required entanglements and this swapping process itself requires two-qubit gates. That swapping is handled in a process called "transpilation", a complex process that serves other purposes as well; this is discussed in more detail in the next lesson. The relevant limiting quantity is thus the transpiled two-qubit depth. The exact maximum depth at which high-fidelity results can be obtained depends on the circuit. But leveraging modern error mitigation techniques, one can obtain high-fidelity results with transpiled two-qubit depths of 80 or more.55:["$","p",null,{"children":"$a7","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]
