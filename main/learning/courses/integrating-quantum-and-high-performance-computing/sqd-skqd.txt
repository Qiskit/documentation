The ansatz prepares a quantum state whose support (the set of basis states it is composed of) should ideally have a large overlap with the support of the true ground state. This circuit allows us to quickly project the ansatz onto computational basis states, which will be further used in classical diagonalization. In other words: we don't have to guess an ansatz that is the ground state; we only need it to contain the same basis states.
