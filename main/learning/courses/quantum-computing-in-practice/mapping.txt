There are other mappings that accomplish a similar goal, including the parity mapping. The calculation of the parity of a state requires consideration of multiple qubits. In the parity mapping (and some others) the interpretation of one qubit corresponding to one orbital does not hold.\nNow let’s walk through a simple example.
