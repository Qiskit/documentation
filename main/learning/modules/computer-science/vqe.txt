However, if an electron absorbs sufficient energy, it can jump to a higher energy level, entering an excited state. This excited state is temporary, and the electron will eventually return to a lower energy level, releasing the absorbed energy, often in the form of light.

In optimization problems, a cost function (also sometimes called an objective function) is a mathematical function that measures how "good" a particular solution is. The goal of the optimizer is to find the set of parameters that minimizes this cost function. In the context of finding the ground state energy of a molecule, the energy itself serves as the cost function – we want to find the parameters for our quantum circuit (our "solution") that yield the lowest possible energy. The classical optimizer uses this measured energy value (the cost) and determines the next set of optimized parameters for the quantum ansatz. These updated parameters are then sent back to the quantum circuit, and the process is repeated. With each iteration, the classical optimizer adjusts the parameters to try and reduce the energy (minimize the cost function) until a predefined convergence criterion is met, ideally ensuring that the lowest possible energy (corresponding to the ground state of the molecule for that bond distance and basis set) is found.4b:["$","p",null,{"children":"$162","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]

28c:T450,VQE is a powerful near-term quantum algorithm, but it's important to be aware of its limitations. The performance of VQE heavily depends on the choice of the ansatz – finding an efficiently preparable ansatz that can accurately represent the true ground state becomes challenging for larger, more complex molecules. Furthermore, current quantum hardware is susceptible to noise, which can impact the accuracy of VQE results, particularly for deeper circuits or larger numbers of qubits. Despite these challenges, VQE serves as a foundational algorithm, and ongoing research is exploring more sophisticated variational methods and error mitigation techniques to push the boundaries of what is possible in quantum chemistry on near-term quantum computers. For instance, algorithms like Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) are being developed, which leverage samples obtained from quantum circuits combined with classical diagonalization in a subspace to improve energy estimation and address some of the limitations faced by VQE, particularly regarding measurement efficiency and noise robustness.dd:["$","p",null,{"children":"$28c","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]
