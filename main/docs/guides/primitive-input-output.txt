The associated PubResult of this job has the following data bins:
 DataBin(evs=np.ndarray(<shape=(3, 100), dtype=float64>), stds=np.ndarray(<shape=(3, 100), dtype=float64>), ensemble_standard_error=np.ndarray(<shape=(3, 100), dtype=float64>), shape=(3, 100))

And this DataBin has attributes: dict_keys(['evs', 'stds', 'ensemble_standard_error'])
Recall that this shape is due to our array of parameter binding sets having shape (100, 2) -- where 2 is the
         number of parameters in the circuit -- combined with our array of observables having shape (3, 1).
