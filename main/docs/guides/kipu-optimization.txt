During the local search, the bits of the measured solution are randomly flipped. After the flip, the energy of the new bitstring is evaluated. If the energy is lower, the bitstring is kept as the new solution. The local search only scales linearly with the number of qubits; hence, it is computationally cheap. Since the post-processing corrects local bitflips, it compensates for bit-flip errors that often are the result of hardware imperfections and readout errors.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]
