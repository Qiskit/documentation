While serial execution reflects the full cumulative cost of exploring multiple layout trials, the serverless job times highlight how parallel execution collapses this cost into a much shorter wall-clock time. As a result, the effective time per transpilation is reduced to a small fraction of that required in the serial setting, largely independent of the heuristic used. This capability is particularly important for optimizing SABRE to its fullest potential. Many of SABRE’s strongest performance gains come from increasing the number of layout and routing trials, which can be prohibitively expensive when executed sequentially.
