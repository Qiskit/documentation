Its significance lies in its ability to factor large integers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm, threatening the security of widely used cryptographic systems like RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. By efficiently solving this problem on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, Shor's algorithm could revolutionize fields such as cryptography, cybersecurity, and computational mathematics, underscoring the transformative power of quantum computation."],"className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}],"\n","$L1f","\n","$L20","\n","$L21","\n","$L22","\n","$L23","\n","$L24","\n","$L25","\n","$L26","\n","$L27","\n","$L28","\n","$L29","\n","$L2a","\n","$L2b","\n","$L2c","\n","$L2d","\n","$L2e","\n","$L2f","\n","$L30","\n","$L31","\n","$L32","\n","$L33","\n","$L34","\n","$L35","\n","$L36","\n","$L37","\n","$L38","\n","$L39","\n","$L3a","\n","$L3b","\n","$L3c","\n","$L3d","\n","$L3e","\n","$L3f","\n","$L40","\n","$L41","\n","$L42","\n","$L43","\n","$L44","\n","$L45","\n","$L46","\n","$L47","\n","$L48","\n","$L49","\n","$L4a","\n","$L4b","\n","$L4c","\n","$L4d","\n","$L4e","\n","$L4f","\n","$L50","\n","$L51","\n","$L52","\n","$L53","\n","$L54","\n","$L55","\n","$L56","\n","$L57","\n","$L58","\n","$L59","\n","$L5a","\n","$L5b","\n","$L5c","\n","$L5d","\n","$L5e","\n","$L5f","\n","$L60","\n","$L61","\n","$L62","\n","$L63","\n","$L64","\n","$L65","\n","$L66","\n","$L67","\n","$L68","\n","$L69","\n","$L6a","\n","$L6b","\n","$L6c","\n","$L6d","\n","$L6e","\n","$L6f","\n","$L70","\n","$L71","\n","$L72","\n","$L73","\n","$L74","\n","$L75","\n","$L76","\n","$L77","\n","$L78","\n","$L79","\n","$L7a","\n","$L7b","\n","$L7c","\n","$L7d","\n","$L7e","\n","$L7f","\n","$L80","\n","$L81","\n","$L82","\n","$L83","\n","$L84","\n","$L85","\n","$L86","\n","$L87","\n","$L88","\n","$L89","\n","$L8a","\n","$L8b","\n","$L8c","\n","$L8d","\n","$L8e","\n","$L8f","\n","$L90","\n","$L91","\n","$L92","\n","$L93","\n","$L94","\n","$L95","\n","$L96","\n","$L97","\n","$L98","\n","$L99","\n","$L9a","\n","$L9b","\n","$L9c","\n","$L9d","\n","$L9e","\n","$L9f","\n","$La0","\n","$La1","\n","$La2","\n","$La3","\n","$La4","\n","$La5","\n","$La6","\n","$La7","\n","$La8","\n","$La9","\n","$Laa","\n","$Lab","\n","$Lac","\n","$Lad","\n","$Lae","\n","$Laf","\n","$Lb0","\n","$Lb1","\n","$Lb2","\n","$Lb3","\n","$Lb4","\n","$Lb5","\n","$Lb6","\n","$Lb7","\n","$Lb8","\n","$Lb9","\n","$Lba","\n","$Lbb","\n","$Lbc","\n","$Lbd","\n","$Lbe"],"$undefined"]}]}]]}],"$Lbf"]}]
