Classical distributed computing is used to process samples obtained from a quantum processor, and to project and diagonalize a target Hamiltonian in a subspace spanned by them. This allows SQD to be robust to samples corrupted by quantum noise and deal with large Hamiltonians, such as chemistry Hamiltonians with millions of interaction terms, beyond the reach of any exact diagonalization methods.
