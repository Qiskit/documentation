Using Multiverse Computing’s “Singularity Machine Learning – Classification” (a Qiskit Function), we train a pool of conventional learners (for example, decision trees, k-NN, logistic regression) and then refine that pool with a quantum layer to improve diversity and generalization. The objective is practical: on a real grid-stability prediction task, we compare a strong classical baseline with a quantum-optimized alternative under the same data splits, so you can see where the quantum step helps and what it costs.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]

Classical heuristics like boosting, bagging, and stacking perform well at moderate scales but can struggle to explore large, redundant libraries of models efficiently. The function integrates quantum algorithms - specifically QAOA (and optionally VQE in other configurations) - to search that space more effectively after the classical learners are trained, increasing the chance of finding a compact, diverse subset that generalizes better.","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]

The heavy lifting on data — preprocessing, training the learner pool, and evaluation — remains classical and can handle millions of examples.

133:T408,The plot confirms the expected scaling pattern. The classical AdaBoost performs strongly for smaller ensembles but becomes increasingly costly to scale as the number of weak learners grows, because its subset-selection problem expands combinatorially. The quantum-enhanced models replicate classical accuracy at low widths and begin to surpass it as ensemble size increases, especially under adaptive α-regularization. This reflects the quantum optimizer’s ability to sample and evaluate many candidate subsets in parallel through superposition, maintaining tractable search even at higher widths. While current hardware overhead offsets some of the theoretical gains, the trend illustrates the scaling efficiency advantage of the quantum formulation. In practical terms, the classical method remains preferable for lightweight benchmarks, while quantum-enhanced ensembles become advantageous as model dimensionality and ensemble size expand, offering better trade-offs between accuracy, generalization, and computational growth.97:["$","p",null,{"children":"$133","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]
