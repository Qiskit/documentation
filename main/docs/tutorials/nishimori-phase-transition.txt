These benchmarks extend the utility of the GEM protocol beyond probing interesting physics. As part of the protocol, you entangled qubits across the entire device using circuits of only constant depth. This feat is only possible due to the protocol's use of mid-circuit measurements. In this experiment, the entangled state was immediately measured, but an interesting avenue to explore would be to continue using the state in additional quantum processing!","className":"group paragraph-el text-text-primary mx-0"}]
