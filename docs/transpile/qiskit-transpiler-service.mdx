# Transpile circuits remotely with the Qiskit transpiler service

The Qiskit transpiler service provides transpilation capabilities on the cloud. In addition to the local Qiskit transpiler capabilities, your transpilation tasks can benefit from both IBM Quantum&trade; cloud resources and AI-powered transpiler passes.

The Qiskit transpiler service offers a Python library to seamlessly integrate this service and its capabilities into your current Qiskit patterns and workflows.

<Admonition type="note">
    This experimental service is only available for IBM Quantum Premium Plan users.
    The service is a beta release, subject to change.
    If you have feedback or want to contact the developer team, please use this [Qiskit Slack Workspace channel](https://qiskit.slack.com/archives/C06KF8YHUAU).

## Install the qiskit-transpiler-service package

To use the Qiskit transpiler service, install the `qiskit-transpiler-service` package:

```sh
pip install qiskit-transpiler-service
```

By default, the package tries to authenticate to IBM Quantum services with the defined Qiskit API token, and uses your token from the `QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN` environment variable or from the file `~/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json` (under the section `default-ibm-quantum`).

*Note*: This package requires Qiskit SDK v1.X.

## qiskit-transpiler-service transpile options

- `backend_name` (optional, str) - A backend name as it would be expected by QiskitRuntimeService (for example, `ibm_sherbrooke`). If this is set, the transpile method uses the layout from the specified backend for the transpilation operation. If any other option is set that impacts these settings, such as `coupling_map`, the `backend_name` settings are overridden.
- `coupling_map` (optional, List[List[int]]) - A valid coupling map list (for example, [[0,1],[1,2]]). If this is set, the transpile method uses this coupling map for the transpilation operation. If defined, it overrides any value specified for `target`.
- `optimization_level` (int) - The potential optimization level to apply during the transpilation process. Valid values are [1,2,3], where 1 is the least optimization (and fastest), and 3 the most optimization (and most time-intensive).
- `ai` ("true", "false", "auto") - Whether to use AI-powered capabilities during transpilation. The AI-powered capabilities available can be for `AIRouting` transpiling passes or other AI-powered synthesis methods. If this value is `"true"`, the service applies different AI-powered transpiling passes depending on the `optimization_level` requested. If  `"false"`, it uses the latest Qiskit transpiling features without AI. Finally, if `"auto"`, the service decides whether to apply the standard Qiskit heuristic passes or the AI-powered passes based on your circuit.
- `qiskit_transpile_options` (dict) - A Python dictionary object that can include any other option that is valid in the [Qiskit `transpile()` method](defaults-and-configuration-options). If the `qiskit_transpile_options` input includes `optimization_level`, it is discarded in favor of the `optimization_level` specified as parameter input. If the `qiskit_transpile_options` includes any option not recognized by the Qiskit `transpile()` method, the library raises an error.

For more information about the available `qiskit-transpiler-service` methods, see the [qiskit-transpiler-service API reference](/api/qiskit-transpiler-service). To learn more about the service API, see the [Qiskit Transpiler Service REST API documentation.](/api/qiskit-transpiler-service-rest)

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to transpile circuits using the Qiskit transpiler service with different parameters.

1. Create a circuit and call the Qiskit transpiler service to transpile the circuit with `ibm_sherbrooke` as the `backend_name`, 3 as the `optimization_level`, and without using AI during the transpilation.

    ```python
    from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2
    from qiskit_transpiler_service.transpiler_service import TranspilerService

    circuit = EfficientSU2(101, entanglement="circular", reps=1).decompose()

    cloud_transpiler_service = TranspilerService(
        backend_name="ibm_sherbrooke",
        ai="false",
        optimization_level=3,
    )
    transpiled_circuit = cloud_transpiler_service.run(circuit)
    ```
*Note*: you only can use backend_name devices you have access to with your IBM Quantum account. Apart from the `backend_name`, the `TranspilerService` also allows `coupling_map` as parameter.

2. Produce a similar circuit and transpile it, requesting AI transpiling capabilities by setting the flag `ai` to `True`:

    ```python
    from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2
    from qiskit_transpiler_service.transpiler_service import TranspilerService

    circuit = EfficientSU2(101, entanglement="circular", reps=1).decompose()

    cloud_transpiler_service = TranspilerService(
        backend_name="ibm_sherbrooke",
        ai="true",
        optimization_level=1,
    )
    transpiled_circuit = cloud_transpiler_service.run(circuit)
    ```

3. Produce a similar circuit and transpile it while letting the service to decide whether to use the AI-powered transpiling passes.


    ```python
    from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2
    from qiskit_transpiler_service.transpiler_service import TranspilerService

    circuit = EfficientSU2(101, entanglement="circular", reps=1).decompose()

    cloud_transpiler_service = TranspilerService(
        backend_name="ibm_sherbrooke",
        ai="auto",
        optimization_level=1,
    )
    transpiled_circuit = cloud_transpiler_service.run(circuit)
    ```

## Citation

If you use any AI-powered feature from the Qiskit transpiler service in your research, use the following recommended citation:
