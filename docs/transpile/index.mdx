# Introduction

Transpilation is the process of rewriting a given input circuit to match the topology of a specific quantum device and optimize the circuit instructions for execution on present-day noisy quantum systems.  This documentation covers the tooling and workflows for local transpilation available to Qiskit users.  If you're using primitives and are only interested in the default transpilation options provided by the Qiskit Runtime service, read the [Configure runtime compilation for Qiskit Runtime](../run/configure-runtime-compilation) topic.

A central component of Qiskit, the transpiler is designed for modularity and extensibility. Its central goal is to be able to easily write new circuit transformations (known as transpiler **passes**), and combine them with other existing passes, allowing you to greatly reduce the depth and complexity of your quantum circuits.  Which passes are chained together and in which order has a major effect on the final outcome. This pipeline is determined by `PassManager` and `StagedPassManager` objects.  The `StagedPassManager` will orchestrate the execution of one or more `PassManagers` and determine the order in which they are executed, while the `PassManager` object is merely a collection of one or more passes.  Think of the `StagedPassManager` as the conductor in an orchestra, the `PassManagers` as the different instrument sections, and the `Passes` as the individual musicians.  In this way, you have the power to compose hardware-efficient quantum circuits that allow you to execute utility-scale work while keeping noise manageable.

Find more information about the pass manager stages in the [Transpiler stages](transpiler-stages) topic.


## Transpiler stages
Qiskit's prebuilt transpiler pipeline consists of six fundamental stages:

1. `init` - This pass runs any initial passes that are required before we start embedding the circuit to the backend.  This typically involves unrolling custom instructions and converting the circuit to all single- and two-qubit gates. (By default this will just validate the circuit instructions and translate multi-qubit gates into single- and two-qubit gates.)
1. `layout` - This pass applies a *layout*, mapping/assigning the virtual qubits in your circuit to the physical qubits of a backend.
1. `routing` - This pass runs after a layout has been applied and will inject gates (i.e., SWAPs) in the original circuit in order to make it compatible with the backend's connectivity/coupling map.
1. `translation` - This pass translates the gates in the circuit to the backend's basis set of instructions.
1. `optimization` - This pass runs an optimization loop to find more efficient decompositions of your quantum circuit until a condition is met (such as a fixed depth).
1. `scheduling` - This stage is for any hardware-aware scheduling passes. If the user specifies a scheduling method, this stage accounts for all idle time in the circuit.

 If you decide to customize your own transpilation workflow, we suggest using these stages as a guideline during development.



## Default transpilation
The basic usage of the transpiler is to call the [`qiskit.compiler.transpile()`](../api/qiskit/compiler#qiskit.compiler.transpile) function.  This will generate and run one of the preset `StagedPassManager`s based on, among other options, an `optimization_level` flag that can be set to either 0, 1, 2, or 3.  Higher levels generate more optimized circuits, at the expense of longer transpilation times.


If you'd like to read more about the preset pass managers or the transpiler stages, visit the section on [Transpiler stages and preset PassManagers](transpiler-stages). To learn how to use the `.transpile()` function, start with the [Transpilation default settings and configuration options](defaults-and-configuration-options) topic.


## Customizing passes
For more advanced users, you can customize your own set of `PassManager` and `StagedPassManager` objects and determine the ordering in which each stage is run.  This can dramatically change the final output circuit. In fact, oftentimes a bespoke approach to transpiling a quantum algorithm produces more efficient error suppression than the default approach.  This involves rewriting quantum circuits to match hardware constraints and suppressing the effects of noise.  The flow of logic for this tool chain is quite customizable and need not be linear.  The transpilation process can even prepare iterative loops, conditional branches, and other complex behaviors.  A good starting place when developing a set of custom passes is to examine the default sequence of transformations.
