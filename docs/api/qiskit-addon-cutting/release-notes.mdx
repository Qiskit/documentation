# Circuit cutting release notes

<span id="release-notes-0-10-0" />

<span id="id2" />

## 0.10.0

<span id="release-notes-0-10-0-prelude" />

### Prelude

This release adds compatibility with Qiskit SDK 2.0.

<span id="release-notes-0-10-0-new-features" />

### New Features

*   This release adds utility functions and a how-to guide for performing circuit cutting with `SparsePauliOp` observables, rather than a `PauliList` of observables.

<span id="release-notes-0-10-0-upgrade-notes" />

### Upgrade Notes

*   Qiskit SDK 1.3.1 or higher is now required. Qiskit SDK 2.0 is now supported.

<span id="release-notes-0-10-0-other-notes" />

### Other Notes

*   This addon is now marked as being incompatible with Qiskit 1.3.0, as the second cutting tutorial fails to execute due to a bug in Qiskit 1.3.0. See discussion in [issue #714](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/issues/714) for more information.

<span id="release-notes-0-9-0" />

<span id="id3" />

## 0.9.0

<span id="release-notes-0-9-0-prelude" />

<span id="id4" />

### Prelude

The most notable change in this release is that the package has been renamed to `qiskit-cutting-addon`. It also marks the removal of this package’s original implementation of wire cutting, CutQC.

<span id="release-notes-0-9-0-new-features" />

<span id="id5" />

### New Features

*   A new `minimum_reached` field has been added to the metadata outputted by `circuit_knitting.cutting.find_cuts()` to check if the cut-finder found a cut scheme that minimized the sampling overhead. Note that the search algorithm employed by the cut-finder is *guaranteed* to find the optimal solution, that is, the solution with the minimum sampling overhead, provided it is allowed to run long enough. The user is free to time-restrict the search by passing in suitable values for `max_backjumps` and/or `max_gamma` to [`OptimizationParameters`](qiskit-addon-cutting#optimizationparameters "qiskit_addon_cutting.OptimizationParameters"). If the search is terminated prematurely in this way, the metadata may indicate that the minimum was not reached, even though the returned solution was actually the optimal solution. This would mean that the search that was performed was not exhaustive enough to prove that the returned solution was optimal.

*   When specifying instances of [`OptimizationParameters`](qiskit-addon-cutting#optimizationparameters "qiskit_addon_cutting.OptimizationParameters") that are inputted to `circuit_knitting.cutting.find_cuts()`, the user can now control whether the cut-finder looks only for gate cuts, only for wire cuts, or both, by setting the bools `gate_lo` and `wire_lo` appropriately. The default value of both of these is set to `True` and so the default search considers the possibility of both gate and wire cuts.

<span id="release-notes-0-9-0-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id6" />

### Upgrade Notes

*   This package now requires updated versions of some dependencies: `qiskit` 1.1 or later, and `qiskit-ibm-runtime` 0.24.0 or later.

*   The search engine inside the automated cut-finder has been primed to avoid extraneous searches and is therefore expected to run faster.

*   The `CutQC` subpackage has been removed, along with its two associated utility modules, `circuit_knitting.utils.metrics` and `circuit_knitting.utils.conversion`. Users are now encouraged to use the automatic cut-finding and gate/wire cutting from the `circuit_knitting.cutting` package.

*   The behavior of [`separate_circuit()`](utils-transforms#separate_circuit "qiskit_addon_cutting.utils.transforms.separate_circuit") and [`partition_problem()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#partition_problem "qiskit_addon_cutting.partition_problem") have changed so that idle qubits are discarded by default. Previously, each idle qubit was placed in its own subcircuit if `partition_labels` was not provided.

<span id="release-notes-0-7-1" />

<span id="id7" />

## 0.7.1

<span id="release-notes-0-7-1-prelude" />

<span id="id8" />

### Prelude

The 0.7.1 release provides a workaround to ensure that the experiments generated by the circuit cutting workflow will execute on IBM Quantum’s hardware backends.

<span id="release-notes-0-7-1-bug-fixes" />

### Bug Fixes

*   Added a workaround so that the classical registers in the generated circuits will always contain at least one bit. This is currently necessary for the experiments to be able to reach IBM Quantum’s hardware backends due to an [openqasm parser issue](https://github.com/openqasm/qe-qasm/issues/37).

<span id="release-notes-0-7-1-other-notes" />

<span id="id9" />

### Other Notes

*   The [`generate_cutting_experiments()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#generate_cutting_experiments "qiskit_addon_cutting.generate_cutting_experiments") function has been optimized for faster execution.

<span id="release-notes-0-7-0" />

<span id="id10" />

## 0.7.0

<span id="release-notes-0-7-0-prelude" />

<span id="id11" />

### Prelude

The 0.7 release introduces an automated cut finding code for the new circuit cutting workflow. With this milestone, the older cutting workflow (CutQC) is now deprecated. Additionally, this is the first CKT release to support version 2 of the Qiskit Runtime primitives. User are encouraged to [migrate to v2 primitives](/docs/guides/v2-primitives) as soon as possible.

<span id="release-notes-0-7-0-new-features" />

<span id="id12" />

### New Features

*   Added a cut-finder function, `circuit_knitting.cutting.find_cuts()`, for automatically identifying locations to place LO gate and wire cuts such that the circuit is separable and runnable, given the maximum number of qubits per subcircuit as a parameter. The cut-finder will search for cut schemes which minimize the sampling overhead. Note, however, that for larger circuits, the number of cuts needed to separate the circuit will naturally grow larger, leading to an exponentially increasing sampling overhead. For instances of wire cuts, the cut-finder assumes no qubit reuse. Therefore, for each wire cut, a new wire is added to the circuit. In addition, the cut-finder requires that every gate in an input circuit be at most a two qubit gate. The search algorithm used by the cut-finder to identify cut locations is Dijkstra’s best first search algorithm which is guaranteed to find solutions with the lowest sampling overhead, provided any user-specified value for the maximum number of allowed backjumps or for the maximum sampling overhead does not prematurely stop the search. If the user wishes to time-restrict the search when running the cut-finder on large circuits, they can specify a maximum sampling overhead and/or a maximum number of allowed backjumps, in which case the cut-finder will return a valid albeit suboptimal cut scheme.

*   Circuit cutting reconstruction can now interpret the [`PrimitiveResult`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.PrimitiveResult) object, which is returned by version 2 of the sampler primitive ([`BaseSamplerV2`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BaseSamplerV2)). See the [migration guide](/docs/guides/qiskit-1.0-features#qiskitprimitives) for details on upgrading to version 2 of the Qiskit primitives.

<span id="release-notes-0-7-0-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id13" />

### Upgrade Notes

*   CKT now requires updated versions of some dependencies: `qiskit` 1.0 or later, `qiskit-aer` 0.14.0 or later, and `qiskit-ibm-runtime` 0.23.0 or later.

*   The code in the `circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.qpd` submodule has been split into three separate files. If you were importing directly from this submodule, you will now need to import from `circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd` instead.

<span id="release-notes-0-7-0-deprecation-notes" />

### Deprecation Notes

*   The `circuit_knitting.cutting.cutqc` package is deprecated and will be removed no sooner than Circuit Knitting Toolbox 0.8.0. The wire cutting functionality in the `circuit_knitting.cutting` package is what will be maintained going forward. Additionally, there is a new automated gate and wire cut-finding functionality in the `circuit_knitting.cutting.automated_cut_finding` module. A [tutorial](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/blob/stable/0.7/docs/circuit_cutting/tutorials/04_automatic_cut_finding.ipynb) has been added to demonstrate automated cut-finding.

<span id="release-notes-0-7-0-other-notes" />

<span id="id14" />

### Other Notes

*   The cutting tutorials have been rephrased with the goal of reconstructing the expectation value of a single [`SparsePauliOp`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp) with many terms, rather than multiple independent [`Pauli`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.quantum_info.Pauli) observables.

*   The [circuit cutting explanation](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-cutting/explanation/index.html) document has been expanded significantly.

<span id="release-notes-0-6-0" />

<span id="id15" />

## 0.6.0

<span id="release-notes-0-6-0-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id16" />

### Upgrade Notes

*   The minimum supported version of `qiskit` is now 0.45.0, and the minimum supported version of `qiskit-ibm-runtime` is now 0.12.2. CKT also now explicitly requires a version of `qiskit` less than 1.0, as there is no guarantee that the current version of CKT will work with Qiskit 1.0.

*   Removed the `circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.QPDBasis.from_gate` method, which has been deprecated since the 0.3 release. [`QPDBasis.from_instruction()`](qpd-qpd-basis#from_instruction "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis.from_instruction") should be used instead.

*   Removed the `circuit_knitting_toolbox` import path. Users should now import from `circuit_knitting` instead.

*   Removed the `circuit_knitting.cutting.decompose_gates` function, which has been deprecated since the 0.3 release. [`cut_gates()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#cut_gates "qiskit_addon_cutting.cut_gates") should be used instead.

*   Removed the `circuit_knitting.cutting.cutting_evaluation` module, which has been deprecated since the 0.4 release. Users should first call `circuit_knitting.cutting.generate_cutting_experiments()` to generate the subexperiment circuits and then submit these circuits directly to the desired Sampler(s).

*   Removed the `circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.generate_qpd_samples` function, which has been deprecated since the 0.3 release. [`generate_qpd_weights()`](qpd#generate_qpd_weights "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.generate_qpd_weights") should be used instead.

*   Removed the `circuit_knitting.cutting.qpd.qpdbasis_from_gate` function, which has been deprecated since the 0.3 release. [`qpdbasis_from_instruction()`](qpd#qpdbasis_from_instruction "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.qpdbasis_from_instruction") should be used instead.

*   The [`generate_cutting_experiments()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#generate_cutting_experiments "qiskit_addon_cutting.generate_cutting_experiments") function now performs some optimizations on the generated circuits before returning them to the user. In particular, it performs the [`RemoveResetInZeroState`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.RemoveResetInZeroState), [`RemoveFinalReset`](utils-transpiler-passes-remove-final-reset "qiskit_addon_cutting.utils.transpiler_passes.RemoveFinalReset"), and [`ConsolidateResets`](utils-transpiler-passes-consolidate-resets "qiskit_addon_cutting.utils.transpiler_passes.ConsolidateResets") passes, so that circuits with cut wires and no re-used qubits are transformed into subexperiments that contain no `Reset`s. This allows such circuits to work on a greater variety of hardware backends.

<span id="release-notes-0-6-0-bug-fixes" />

<span id="id17" />

### Bug Fixes

*   It is now possible to serialize [`SingleQubitQPDGate`](qpd-single-qubit-qpd-gate "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.SingleQubitQPDGate")s using [`qpy`](/docs/api/qiskit/qpy#module-qiskit.qpy), but some other issues with serialization and deserialization still remain. See issue [#455](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/issues/445) for details.

<span id="release-notes-0-6-0-other-notes" />

<span id="id18" />

### Other Notes

*   Removed the entanglement forging tool, as the Qiskit application modules are no longer supported, and packages in `Qiskit-Extensions` may not have dependency on those modules. With this change, CKT no longer depends on `qiskit-algorithms` or Qiskit Nature.

<span id="release-notes-0-5-0" />

<span id="id19" />

## 0.5.0

<span id="release-notes-0-5-0-prelude" />

<span id="id20" />

### Prelude

The primary purpose of this release is to swap the order of the classical registers in the circuits generated the `circuit_knitting.cutting` module. With this change, `"observable_measurements"` now comes before `"qpd_measurements"`, and there is no longer a need to insert `num_qpd_bits` into the result metadata by hand.

<span id="release-notes-0-5-0-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id21" />

### Upgrade Notes

*   CKT now depends on the [qiskit-algorithms](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms) package. This new package replaces the `qiskit.algorithms` module, which was deprecated in Qiskit 0.44.

*   The order of the classical registers in the generated experiments has been swapped. The `"observable_measurements"` register now comes first, and the `"qpd_measurements"` register now comes second. As a result of this change, it is no longer necessary to manually insert `num_qpd_bits` into the `metadata` for each experiment’s result.

*   Removed the `circuit_knitting.cutting.wire_cutting` module. Users are now expected to import from the `circuit_knitting.cutting.cutqc` module instead.

<span id="release-notes-0-5-0-other-notes" />

<span id="id22" />

### Other Notes

*   `qiskit-nature` is now pinned to version 0.6.X, as the entanglement forging code has not yet been updated to work with Qiskit Nature 0.7.0. Compatibility with Qiskit Nature 0.7.0 is tracked by [issue #406](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/issues/406).

<span id="release-notes-0-4-0" />

<span id="id23" />

## 0.4.0

<span id="release-notes-0-4-0-prelude" />

<span id="id24" />

### Prelude

The primary goal of this release is to modify the circuit cutting workflow to enable direct use of the Sampler primitive. Previously, the Sampler was called in `execute_experiments()`, a function which is now deprecated in favor of [`generate_cutting_experiments()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#generate_cutting_experiments "qiskit_addon_cutting.generate_cutting_experiments").

<span id="release-notes-0-4-0-new-features" />

<span id="id25" />

### New Features

*   Added a module, `circuit_knitting.cutting.cutting_experiments`, which is intended to hold functions used for generating the quantum experiments needed for circuit cutting. This module will initially hold one function, [`generate_cutting_experiments()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#generate_cutting_experiments "qiskit_addon_cutting.generate_cutting_experiments"), which can be used to generate quantum experiments, given an input circuit containing [`BaseQPDGate`](qpd-base-qpd-gate "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.BaseQPDGate") instances, some observables, and a number of times the joint quasi-probability distribution for the cuts should be sampled.

<span id="release-notes-0-4-0-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id26" />

### Upgrade Notes

*   The `circuit-knitting-toolbox` Python package now depends on `qiskit` rather than `qiskit-terra`. This should have no user-visible effects, but it is something to keep in mind if one sees dependency errors when upgrading CKT.

*   The `execute_experiments()` function now returns a [`SamplerResult`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.SamplerResult) instance for each circuit partition, rather than the 3D list of quasi-distributions returned previously. The quasi-distribution for each subexperiment can be accessed via the `quasi_dists` field of [`SamplerResult`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.SamplerResult). The number of QPD bits contained in each subexperiment will be included in the `num_qpd_bits` field of the `metadata` dictionary for each experiment result. The output of this function is still valid as input to [`reconstruct_expectation_values()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#reconstruct_expectation_values "qiskit_addon_cutting.reconstruct_expectation_values").

*   [`reconstruct_expectation_values()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#reconstruct_expectation_values "qiskit_addon_cutting.reconstruct_expectation_values") now takes, as its first argument, a [`SamplerResult`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.SamplerResult) instance or a dictionary mapping partition labels to [`SamplerResult`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.SamplerResult) instances. This new `results` argument replaces the old `quasi_dists` argument. The [`SamplerResult`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.SamplerResult) instances are expected to contain the number of QPD bits used in each circuit input to the Sampler. This should be specified in the `num_qpd_bits` field of the experiment result metadata.

<span id="release-notes-0-4-0-deprecation-notes" />

<span id="id27" />

### Deprecation Notes

*   The `execute_experiments()` function has been deprecated. Going forward, users should first call [`generate_cutting_experiments()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#generate_cutting_experiments "qiskit_addon_cutting.generate_cutting_experiments") to generate the subexperiment circuits and then submit these circuits directly to the desired Sampler(s). The [tutorials](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-cutting/tutorials/index.html) have been updated with this new workflow.

<span id="release-notes-0-3-0" />

<span id="id28" />

## 0.3.0

<span id="release-notes-0-3-0-prelude" />

<span id="id29" />

### Prelude

The 0.3.0 release introduces significant new features while maintaining backwards compatibility with the 0.2.0 release. The most striking change in this release is the shortened module names: `circuit_knitting_toolbox` has been renamed to `circuit_knitting`, `entanglement_forging` has been renamed to `forging`, and `circuit_cutting` has been renamed to `cutting`. The new circuit cutting module contains significant enhancements, including support for wire cutting and for the cutting of arbitrary two-qubit gates.

<span id="release-notes-0-3-0-new-features" />

<span id="id30" />

### New Features

*   The circuit cutting module now supports the cutting of arbitrary two-qubit gates. This is supported via a KAK decomposition, using Qiskit’s `TwoQubitWeylDecomposition`, following the method in [arXiv:2006.11174](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11174).

    Additionally, this release adds *explicit* support (i.e., without relying on a KAK decomposition) for the following gates:

    *   [`CHGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CHGate)
    *   [`CYGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CYGate)
    *   [`CSGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CSGate)
    *   [`CSXGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CSXGate)
    *   [`CSdgGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CSdgGate)
    *   [`CPhaseGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CPhaseGate)
    *   [`ECRGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.ECRGate)
    *   [`SwapGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.SwapGate)
    *   [`iSwapGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.iSwapGate)
    *   [`DCXGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.DCXGate)

*   [`partition_problem()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#partition_problem "qiskit_addon_cutting.partition_problem") now works even if `partition_labels` is not explicitly provided. In this case, the labels are determined automatically from the connectivity of the input circuit. For the sake of determining connectivity, [`TwoQubitQPDGate`](qpd-two-qubit-qpd-gate "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.TwoQubitQPDGate")s are ignored, as these instructions are already marked for cutting. To support this workflow, this release also introduces a new method, [`TwoQubitQPDGate.from_instruction()`](qpd-two-qubit-qpd-gate#from_instruction "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.TwoQubitQPDGate.from_instruction"), which allows one to create a [`TwoQubitQPDGate`](qpd-two-qubit-qpd-gate "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.TwoQubitQPDGate") that wraps a given instruction.

*   Dynamic Definition code has been added to the `cutqc` module. See pull request [#285](https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/pull/285) for details.

*   Users may now bypass experiments associated with the Hartree-Fock bitstring and replace their results with a specified Hartree-Fock value using the `hf_energy` class field in `circuit_knitting.forging.EntanglementForgingGroundStateSolver`. Refer to the `explanatory material <Fixing the Hartree-Fock Bitstring>` for more information.

*   `generate_qpd_weights()` now returns a mixture of exact and sampled weights when appropriate. Specifically, it exactly evaluates all weights greater than or equal to `1 / num_samples` and samples from the remaining weights (ones which are below this threshold). Previously, this function would only return exact weights if *all* weights were greater than or equal to `1 / num_samples`; otherwise, all weights were sampled. The new behavior is expected to improve performance on non-uniform quasi-probability decompositions, e.g. for cut instantiations of [`RXXGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RXXGate), [`RYYGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RYYGate), [`RZZGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RZZGate), [`CRXGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CRXGate), [`CRYGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CRYGate), and [`CRZGate`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CRZGate) away from $\theta=\pi/2$.

*   The `circuit_knitting.cutting` module now supports wire cutting. There is a [new tutorial](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-cutting/tutorials/index.html) that explains how to use it.

<span id="release-notes-0-3-0-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id31" />

### Upgrade Notes

*   `execute_experiments()` no longer creates separate jobs for each subcircuit by default. Now, separate jobs are only created if separate [BaseSampler](/docs/api/qiskit/1.4/qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler) instances are provided for each circuit partition.

*   Numpy 1.23.0 or later is now required. The [`kron()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.kron.html#numpy.kron) method in earlier versions [has known performance issues](https://github.com/Qiskit-Extensions/circuit-knitting-toolbox/pull/70#issuecomment-1500514513), and this method is used heavily by the CutQC wire cutting module.

*   The dependency on the `qiskit.opflow` module has been removed from entanglement forging. With this change, Qiskit Nature 0.6.0 is now required. However, Qiskit Nature 0.6.0 is incompatible with Quantum Serverless, so users that wish to use entanglement forging with Quantum Serverless must remain on version 0.2 of the Circuit Knitting Toolbox until [issue #108](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/issues/108) is resolved.

*   [`BaseQPDGate`](qpd-base-qpd-gate "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.BaseQPDGate") instances in subcircuits returned from [`partition_circuit_qubits()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#partition_circuit_qubits "qiskit_addon_cutting.partition_circuit_qubits") and [`partition_problem()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#partition_problem "qiskit_addon_cutting.partition_problem") will now have labels prefixed with “cut”, rather than “qpd”.

<span id="release-notes-0-3-0-deprecation-notes" />

<span id="id32" />

### Deprecation Notes

*   `decompose_gates()` is deprecated and will be removed no sooner than v0.4.0. Users should migrate to the identical [`cut_gates()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#cut_gates "qiskit_addon_cutting.cut_gates") function.

*   `generate_qpd_samples()` has been renamed to `generate_qpd_weights()`. The original name will be removed no sooner than version 0.4 of the Circuit Knitting Toolbox.

*   `QPDBasis.from_gate()` has been renamed to [`QPDBasis.from_instruction()`](qpd-qpd-basis#from_instruction "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis.from_instruction"). The original name is deprecated and will be removed no sooner than CKT v0.4.0.

*   The top-level name for imports has been renamed from `circuit_knitting_toolbox` to `circuit_knitting`. Furthermore, the following renames have occurred one level deeper:

    *   `circuit_knitting_toolbox.entanglement_forging` has been moved to `circuit_knitting.forging`.
    *   `circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting` has been moved to `circuit_knitting.cutting`.

    The old import locations are now deprecated and will be removed in a future release of the Circuit Knitting Toolbox.

<span id="release-notes-0-3-0-bug-fixes" />

<span id="id33" />

### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed a bug in `decompose_qpd_instructions()` which would cause index errors if `TwoQubitQPDGate` indices were not specified in ascending order.

*   Fixed a bug in `circuit_knitting.forging.EntanglementForgingGroundStateSolver` which was causing `AttributeError`s when instantiating the :class:`circuit_knitting.forging.EntanglementForgingResult` in certain conditions, such as when reducing the orbitals over which to solve.

<span id="release-notes-0-2-0" />

<span id="id34" />

## 0.2.0

<span id="release-notes-0-2-0-prelude" />

<span id="id35" />

### Prelude

0.2.0 is centered around the addition of functions which allow for the easy implementation of a circuit cutting technique called gate cutting. For more details on circuit cutting, check out our [explanation guide](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-cutting/explanation/index.html).

The foundation of the `circuit_cutting` package is the `circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd` sub-package. The `qpd` package allows for easy transformation of [`QuantumCircuit`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) gates and wires into elements which may be decomposed to a probabilistic set of basis gates. See `QPDBasis` and `BaseQPDGate` classes for more information.

Additionally, 0.2.0 includes a set of functions which allow for easy implementation of gate cutting workflows. These functions are built on top of the `circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.qpd` package. Like all circuit knitting techniques, gate cutting can be described as three consecutive stages: *decomposition* of a problem, *execution* of many subexperiments, and *reconstruction* of a simulated output of the original problem. These steps may be implemented with the `circuit_cutting` package using only a few primary functions, namely, the [`partition_problem()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#partition_problem "qiskit_addon_cutting.partition_problem"), `decompose_gates()`, `execute_experiments()`, and [`reconstruct_expectation_values()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#reconstruct_expectation_values "qiskit_addon_cutting.reconstruct_expectation_values") functions. Check out the [tutorials](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-cutting/tutorials/index.html) for a look at a couple of example circuit cutting workflows.

<span id="release-notes-0-2-0-new-features" />

<span id="id36" />

### New Features

*   Addition of a `qpd` package which allows for easy transformation of [`QuantumCircuit`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) gates and wires into elements which may be decomposed to a probabilistic set of basis gates. See `QPDBasis` and `BaseQPDGate` classes for more information.

*   Addition of `cutting_decomposition`, `cutting_execution`, and `cutting_reconstruction` modules. These modules provide several functions which allow for easy implementation of gate cutting workflows, namely, the [`partition_problem()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#partition_problem "qiskit_addon_cutting.partition_problem"), `decompose_gates()`, `execute_experiments()`, and [`reconstruct_expectation_values()`](qiskit-addon-cutting#reconstruct_expectation_values "qiskit_addon_cutting.reconstruct_expectation_values") functions.

### Known Issues

*   The `circuit_cutting` package only supports [`PauliList`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.quantum_info.PauliList) observables for calculating expectation values. Support for calculating expectation values for more observable types, including [`SparsePauliOp`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp), is expected no sooner than 0.3.0.

*   The `Sampler`s from Qiskit and Qiskit Aer do not support mid-circuit measurements in statevector mode. For more on generating exact quasi-distributions using the [BaseSampler](/docs/api/qiskit/1.4/qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler) interface, check out our [how-to guide](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/blob/stable/0.7/docs/circuit_cutting/how-tos/how_to_generate_exact_quasi_dists_from_sampler.ipynb).

*   The `circuit_cutting` package generally does not yet support input circuits with user-added classical bits, so by extension, it does not yet support dynamic circuits.

### Upgrade Notes

*   Support for running with Python 3.7 has been removed. To run the Circuit Knitting Toolbox, you now need Python version 3.8 or higher.

### Deprecation Notes

*   The `circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.wire_cutting` namespace is now deprecated. It has been renamed to `circuit_knitting_toolbox.circuit_cutting.cutqc`. Both gate and wire cutting for simulating expectation values will be implemented directly into the `circuit_cutting` package, and the `circuit_cutting.cutqc` package will remain available for users of the automatic cut finding and/or the full probability distribution reconstruction.

### Upgrade Notes

*   The minimum supported version of each Qiskit dependency has been updated. This release depends on `qiskit-terra>=0.23.3`, `qiskit-aer>=0.12.0`, `qiskit-nature>=0.5.2`, and `qiskit-ibm-runtime>=0.9.2`. `qiskit-ibmq-provider` is now deprecated and is no longer required by the Circuit Knitting Toolbox.

*   Support for Qiskit Nature \< 0.5 has been removed upon this release.

    Users are now be required to use the `qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem`, as input to the `EntanglementForgingGroundStateSolver`, rather than the deprecated `qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.ElectronicStructureProblem`.

    For more information on migrating to Qiskit Nature 0.5, check out the [Qiskit Nature migration guide](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-nature/migration/0.5_a_intro.html).

    For more information on adapting your entanglement forging workflows, check out the `tutorials <Forging tutorials>` and `how-to guides <Forging how-tos>`.

*   The `~circuit_knitting_toolbox.utils.IntegralDriver` class has been removed. The new Qiskit Nature API allows for a more flexible build-up of the `qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem`, and this driver is no longer needed.

*   DOcplex and cplex are now optional dependencies. They must be installed for automatic wire cut finding to work.
