# Quasi-Probability Decomposition (QPD)

`qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd`

Main quasiprobability decomposition functionality.

### QPDBasis

<Class id="qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis" github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/tree/stable/0.9/qiskit_addon_cutting/qpd/qpd_basis.py" signature="QPDBasis(maps, coeffs)" modifiers="class">
  Basis in which to decompose an operation.

  This class defines a basis in which a quantum operation will be decomposed. The ideal (noise-free) quantum operation will be decomposed into a quasiprobabilistic mixture of noisy circuits.

  Assign member variables.

  A mapping from a given decomposition to its weight. Keys are tuples of indices – one index per input [`QPDBasis`](#qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis"). The indices correspond to a specific decomposition mapping in the basis.

  Values are tuples. The first element is a number corresponding to the weight of the contribution. The second element is the [`WeightType`](#qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.WeightType "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.WeightType"), either `EXACT` or `SAMPLED`.

### decompose\_qpd\_instructions

### qpdbasis\_from\_instruction

<Function id="qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.qpdbasis_from_instruction" github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/tree/stable/0.9/qiskit_addon_cutting/qpd/decompositions.py" signature="qpdbasis_from_instruction(gate, /)">
  Generate a [`QPDBasis`](#qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis "qiskit_addon_cutting.qpd.QPDBasis") object, given a supported operation.

  All two-qubit gates which implement the [`to_matrix()`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.Gate#to_matrix "(in Qiskit v1.2)") method are supported. This should include the vast majority of gates with no unbound parameters, but there are some special cases (see, e.g., [qiskit issue #10396](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/10396)).

  The [`Move`](instructions#move "qiskit_addon_cutting.instructions.Move") operation, which can be used to specify a wire cut, is also supported.
