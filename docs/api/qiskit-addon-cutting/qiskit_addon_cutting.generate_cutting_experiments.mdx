# qiskit\_addon\_cutting.generate\_cutting\_experiments

<Function id="qiskit_addon_cutting.generate_cutting_experiments" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-cutting/tree/stable/0.9/qiskit_addon_cutting/cutting_experiments.py" signature="generate_cutting_experiments(circuits, observables, num_samples)">
  Generate cutting subexperiments and their associated coefficients.

  If the input, `circuits`, is a `QuantumCircuit` instance, the output subexperiments will be contained within a 1D array, and `observables` is expected to be a `PauliList` instance.

  If the input circuit and observables are specified by dictionaries with partition labels as keys, the output subexperiments will be returned as a dictionary which maps each partition label to a 1D array containing the subexperiments associated with that partition.

  In both cases, the subexperiment lists are ordered as follows:

  > $[sample_{0}observable_{0}, \ldots, sample_{0}observable_{N-1}, sample_{1}observable_{0}, \ldots, sample_{M-1}observable_{N-1}]$

  The coefficients will always be returned as a 1D array – one coefficient for each unique sample.

  **Parameters**

  *   **circuits** (QuantumCircuit | dict\[Hashable, QuantumCircuit]) – The circuit(s) to partition and separate
  *   **observables** (PauliList | dict\[Hashable, PauliList]) – The observable(s) to evaluate for each unique sample
  *   **num\_samples** (int | float) – The number of samples to draw from the quasi-probability distribution. If set to infinity, the weights will be generated rigorously rather than by sampling from the distribution.

  **Return type**

  tuple\[list\[QuantumCircuit] | dict\[Hashable, list\[QuantumCircuit]], list\[tuple\[float, WeightType]]]

  **Returns**

  A tuple containing the cutting experiments and their associated coefficients. If the input circuits is a `QuantumCircuit` instance, the output subexperiments will be a sequence of circuits – one for every unique sample and observable. If the input circuits are represented as a dictionary keyed by partition labels, the output subexperiments will also be a dictionary keyed by partition labels and containing the subexperiments for each partition. The coefficients are always a sequence of length-2 tuples, where each tuple contains the coefficient and the `WeightType`. Each coefficient corresponds to one unique sample.

  **Raises**

  *   [**ValueError**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "(in Python v3.12)") – `num_samples` must be at least one.
  *   [**ValueError**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "(in Python v3.12)") – `circuits` and `observables` are incompatible types
  *   [**ValueError**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "(in Python v3.12)") – `SingleQubitQPDGate` instances must have their cut ID appended to the gate label so they may be associated with other gates belonging to the same cut.
  *   [**ValueError**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError "(in Python v3.12)") – `SingleQubitQPDGate` instances are not allowed in unseparated circuits.
