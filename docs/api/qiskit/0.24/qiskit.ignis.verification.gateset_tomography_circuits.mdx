# qiskit.ignis.verification.gateset\_tomography\_circuits

<Function id="qiskit.ignis.verification.gateset_tomography_circuits" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-ignis/tree/stable/0.5/qiskit/ignis/verification/tomography/basis/circuits.py" signature="gateset_tomography_circuits(measured_qubits=None, gateset_basis='default')">
  Return a list of quantum gate set tomography (GST) circuits.

  The circuits are fully constructed from the data given in gateset\_basis. Note that currently this is only implemented for the single-qubits.

  **Parameters**

  *   **measured\_qubits** (`Optional`\[`List`\[`int`]]) – The qubits to perform GST. If None GST will be performed on qubit-0.
  *   **gateset\_basis** (`Union`\[`str`, `GateSetBasis`]) – The gateset and SPAM data.

  **Return type**

  `List`\[`QuantumCircuit`]

  **Returns**

  A list of QuantumCircuit objects containing the original circuit with state preparation circuits prepended, and measurement circuits appended.

  **Raises**

  **QiskitError** – If called for more than 1 measured qubit.

  ## Additional Information:

  Gate set tomography is performed on a gate set (G0, G1,…,Gm) with the additional information of SPAM circuits (F0,F1,…,Fn) that are constructed from the gates in the gate set.

  In gate set tomography, we assume a single initial state rho and a single POVM measurement operator E. The SPAM circuits now provide us with a complete set of initial state F\_j|rho> and measurements \<E|F\_i.

  We perform three types of experiments:

  1.  ## $\langle E | F_i G_k F_j |\rho \rangle$ for 1 \<= i,j \<= n

      and 1 \<= k \<= m: This experiment enables us to obtain data on the gate G\_k

  2.  ## $\langle E | F_i F_j |\rho \rangle$ for 1 \<= i,j \<= n:

      This experiment enables us to obtain the Gram matrix required to “invert” the results of experiments of type 1 in order to reconstruct (a matrix similar to) the gate G\_k

  3.  ## $\langle E | F_j |\rho \rangle$ for 1 \<= j \<= n:

      This experiment enables us to reconstruct \<E| and rho

  The result of this method is the set of all the circuits needed for these experiments, suitably labeled with a tuple of the corresponding gate/SPAM labels
