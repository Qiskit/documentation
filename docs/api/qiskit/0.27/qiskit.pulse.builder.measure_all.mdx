# qiskit.pulse.builder.measure\_all

<Function id="qiskit.pulse.builder.measure_all" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.17/qiskit/pulse/builder.py" signature="measure_all()">
  Measure all qubits within the currently active builder context.

  A simple macro function to measure all of the qubits in the device at the same time. This is useful for handling device `meas_map` and single measurement constraints.

  Examples:

  ```python
  from qiskit import pulse
  from qiskit.test.mock import FakeOpenPulse2Q

  backend = FakeOpenPulse2Q()

  with pulse.build(backend) as pulse_prog:
      # Measure all qubits and return associated registers.
      regs = pulse.measure_all()
  ```

  <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
    Requires the active builder context to have a backend set.
  </Admonition>

  **Return type**

  `List`\[[`MemorySlot`](qiskit.pulse.channels#memoryslot "qiskit.pulse.channels.MemorySlot")]

  **Returns**

  The `register`s the qubit measurement results will be stored in.
