# qiskit.pulse.transforms.block\_to\_dag

<Function id="qiskit.pulse.transforms.block_to_dag" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.22/qiskit/pulse/transforms/dag.py" signature="block_to_dag(block)">
  Convert schedule block instruction into DAG.

  `ScheduleBlock` can be represented as a DAG as needed. For example, equality of two programs are efficiently checked on DAG representation.

  ```python
  with pulse.build() as sched1:
      with pulse.align_left():
          pulse.play(my_gaussian0, pulse.DriveChannel(0))
          pulse.shift_phase(1.57, pulse.DriveChannel(2))
          pulse.play(my_gaussian1, pulse.DriveChannel(1))

  with pulse.build() as sched2:
      with pulse.align_left():
          pulse.shift_phase(1.57, pulse.DriveChannel(2))
          pulse.play(my_gaussian1, pulse.DriveChannel(1))
          pulse.play(my_gaussian0, pulse.DriveChannel(0))
  ```

  Here the `sched1 `` and ``sched2` are different implementations of the same program, but it is difficult to confirm on the list representation.

  Another example is instruction optimization.

  ```python
  with pulse.build() as sched:
      with pulse.align_left():
          pulse.shift_phase(1.57, pulse.DriveChannel(1))
          pulse.play(my_gaussian0, pulse.DriveChannel(0))
          pulse.shift_phase(-1.57, pulse.DriveChannel(1))
  ```

  In above program two `shift_phase` instructions can be cancelled out because they are consecutive on the same drive channel. This can be easily found on the DAG representation.

  **Parameters**

  **block** (*"ScheduleBlock"*) – A schedule block to be converted.

  **Return type**

  `PyDAG`

  **Returns**

  Instructions in DAG representation.

  **Raises**

  [**PulseError**](pulse#qiskit.pulse.PulseError "qiskit.pulse.PulseError") – When the context is invalid subclass.
