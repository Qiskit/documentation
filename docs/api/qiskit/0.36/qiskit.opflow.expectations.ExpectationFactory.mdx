# ExpectationFactory

<Class id="qiskit.opflow.expectations.ExpectationFactory" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.20/qiskit/opflow/expectations/expectation_factory.py" signature="ExpectationFactory" modifiers="class">
  Bases: `object`

  A factory class for convenient automatic selection of an Expectation based on the Operator to be converted and backend used to sample the expectation value.

  ### build

  <Function id="qiskit.opflow.expectations.ExpectationFactory.build" signature="ExpectationFactory.build(operator, backend=None, include_custom=True)" modifiers="static">
    A factory method for convenient automatic selection of an Expectation based on the Operator to be converted and backend used to sample the expectation value.

    **Parameters**

    *   **operator** (`OperatorBase`) – The Operator whose expectation value will be taken.
    *   **backend** (`Union`\[`Backend`, `BaseBackend`, `QuantumInstance`, `None`]) – The backend which will be used to sample the expectation value.
    *   **include\_custom** (`bool`) – Whether the factory will include the (Aer) specific custom expectations if their behavior against the backend might not be as expected. For instance when using Aer qasm\_simulator with paulis the Aer snapshot can be used but the outcome lacks shot noise and hence does not intuitively behave overall as people might expect when choosing a qasm\_simulator. It is however fast as long as the more state vector like behavior is acceptable.

    **Return type**

    `ExpectationBase`

    **Returns**

    The expectation algorithm which best fits the Operator and backend.

    **Raises**

    **ValueError** – If operator is not of a composition for which we know the best Expectation method.
