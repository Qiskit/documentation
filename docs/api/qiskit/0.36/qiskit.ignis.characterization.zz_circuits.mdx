# qiskit.ignis.characterization.zz\_circuits

<Function id="qiskit.ignis.characterization.zz_circuits" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-ignis/tree/stable/0.7/qiskit/ignis/characterization/hamiltonian/circuits.py" signature="zz_circuits(num_of_gates, gate_time, qubits, spectators, nosc=5)">
  Generates circuit for measuring ZZ. Two Ramsey experiments, the first with the spectator in the ground state, the second with the spectator in the excited state

  **Parameters**

  *   **num\_of\_gates** (*list of integers*) – the number of identity gates in each circuit. Must be in an increasing order.
  *   **gate\_time** (*float*) – time of running a single gate.
  *   **qubits** (*list of integers*) – indices of the qubits to measure and perform the Ramsey
  *   **spectators** (*list of integers*) – indices of the qubits to flip the state (ie measure the ZZ between qubits and spectators). Must be the same length as qubits
  *   **nosc** (*int*) – number of oscillations to induce using the phase gate

  **Returns**

  A list of QuantumCircuit xdata: a list of delay times osc\_freq: the induced oscillation frequency

  **Raises**

  **ValueError** – If the number of qubits differs from the number of spectators
