# align\_measures

<Function id="qiskit.pulse.reschedule.align_measures" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.14/qiskit/pulse/reschedule.py" signature="align_measures(schedules, inst_map=None, cal_gate='u3', max_calibration_duration=None, align_time=None)">
  Return new schedules where measurements occur at the same physical time. Minimum measurement wait time (to allow for calibration pulses) is enforced.

  This is only defined for schedules that are acquire-less or acquire-final per channel: a schedule with pulses or acquires occurring on a channel which has already had a measurement will throw an error.

  **Parameters**

  *   **schedules** (`Iterable`\[`ScheduleComponent`]) – Collection of schedules to be aligned together
  *   **inst\_map** (`Optional`\[[`InstructionScheduleMap`](qiskit.pulse.InstructionScheduleMap "qiskit.pulse.instruction_schedule_map.InstructionScheduleMap")]) – Mapping of circuit operations to pulse schedules
  *   **cal\_gate** (`str`) – The name of the gate to inspect for the calibration time
  *   **max\_calibration\_duration** (`Optional`\[`int`]) – If provided, inst\_map and cal\_gate will be ignored
  *   **align\_time** (`Optional`\[`int`]) – If provided, this will be used as final align time.

  **Return type**

  [`Schedule`](qiskit.pulse.Schedule "qiskit.pulse.schedule.Schedule")

  **Returns**

  Schedule

  **Raises**

  [**PulseError**](qiskit.pulse.PulseError "qiskit.pulse.PulseError") – if an acquire or pulse is encountered on a channel that has already been part of an acquire, or if align\_time is negative
