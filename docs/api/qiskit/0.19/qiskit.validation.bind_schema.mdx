# bind\_schema

<Function id="qiskit.validation.bind_schema" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.14/qiskit/validation/base.py" signature="bind_schema(schema, **kwargs)">
  Class decorator for adding schema validation to its instances.

  The decorator acts on the model class by adding:

  *   a class attribute `schema` with the schema used for validation
  *   a class attribute `shallow_schema` used for validation during instantiation.

  The same schema cannot be bound more than once. If you need to reuse a schema for a different class, create a new schema subclassing the one you want to reuse and leave the new empty:

  ```python
  class MySchema(BaseSchema):
      title = String()

  class AnotherSchema(MySchema):
      pass

  @bind_schema(MySchema):
  class MyModel(BaseModel):
      pass

  @bind_schema(AnotherSchema):
  class AnotherModel(BaseModel):
      pass
  ```

  <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
    By default, models decorated with this decorator are validated during instantiation. If `validate=False` is passed to the constructor, this validation will not be performed.
  </Admonition>

  **Parameters**

  *   **schema** (*class*) – the schema class used for validation.
  *   **\*\*kwargs** – Additional attributes for the `marshmallow.Schema` initializer.

  **Raises**

  **ValueError** – when trying to bind the same schema more than once.

  **Returns**

  the same class with validation capabilities.

  **Return type**
