# lookuptable\_decoding

<Function id="qiskit.ignis.verification.lookuptable_decoding" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-ignis/tree/stable/0.3/qiskit/ignis/verification/topological_codes/fitters.py" signature="lookuptable_decoding(training_results, real_results)">
  Calculates the logical error probability using postselection decoding. This postselects all results with trivial syndrome.

  **Parameters**

  *   **training\_results** (*dict*) – A results dictionary, as produced by the `process_results` method of a code.
  *   **real\_results** (*dict*) – A results dictionary, as produced by the `process_results` method of a code.

  **Returns**

  **Dictionary of logical error probabilities for**

  each of the encoded logical states whose results were given in the input.

  **Return type**

  dict

  ## Additional information:

  Given a two dictionaries of results, as produced by a code object, thelogical error probability is calculated for lookup table decoding. This is done using training\_results as a guide to which syndrome is most probable for each logical value, and the probability is calculated for the results in real\_results.
