# qiskit.pulse.transforms.add\_implicit\_acquires

<Function id="qiskit.pulse.transforms.add_implicit_acquires" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.18/qiskit/pulse/transforms/canonicalization.py" signature="add_implicit_acquires(schedule, meas_map)">
  Return a new schedule with implicit acquires from the measurement mapping replaced by explicit ones.

  <Admonition title="Warning" type="caution">
    Since new acquires are being added, Memory Slots will be set to match the qubit index. This may overwrite your specification.
  </Admonition>

  **Parameters**

  *   **schedule** (`Union`\[`Schedule`, `Instruction`]) – Schedule to be aligned.
  *   **meas\_map** (`List`\[`List`\[`int`]]) – List of lists of qubits that are measured together.

  **Return type**

  `Schedule`

  **Returns**

  A `Schedule` with the additional acquisition instructions.
