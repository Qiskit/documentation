`IQXDebugging.update([E, ]**F) → None. Update D from dict/iterable E and F.`

If E is present and has a .keys() method, then does: for k in E: D\[k] = E\[k] If E is present and lacks a .keys() method, then does: for k, v in E: D\[k] = v In either case, this is followed by: for k in F: D\[k] = F\[k]
