# qiskit.pulse.channels

This module defines Pulse Channels. Channels include:

> *   transmit channels, which should subclass `PulseChannel`
> *   receive channels, such as `AcquireChannel`
> *   non-signal “channels” such as `SnapshotChannel`, `MemorySlot` and `RegisterChannel`.

Novel channel types can often utilize the `ControlChannel`, but if this is not sufficient, new channel types can be created. Then, they must be supported in the PulseQobj schema and the assembler.

**Classes**

|                                       |                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AcquireChannel`(index)               | Acquire channels are used to collect data.                                                     |
| `Channel`(index)                      | Base class of channels.                                                                        |
| `ControlChannel`(index)               | Control channels provide supplementary control over the qubit to the drive channel.            |
| `DriveChannel`(index)                 | Drive channels transmit signals to qubits which enact gate operations.                         |
| `MeasureChannel`(index)               | Measure channels transmit measurement stimulus pulses for readout.                             |
| `MemorySlot`(index)                   | Memory slot channels represent classical memory storage.                                       |
| `PulseChannel`(index)                 | Base class of transmit Channels.                                                               |
| `RegisterSlot`(index)                 | Classical resister slot channels represent classical registers (low-latency classical memory). |
| `SnapshotChannel`(\*args, \*\*kwargs) | Snapshot channels are used to specify instructions for simulators.                             |
