# XXDecomposer

<Class id="qiskit.quantum_info.XXDecomposer" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.19/qiskit/quantum_info/synthesis/xx_decompose/decomposer.py" signature="XXDecomposer(euler_basis='U', embodiments=None, backup_optimizer=None)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: `object`

  A class for optimal decomposition of 2-qubit unitaries into 2-qubit basis gates of XX type (i.e., each locally equivalent to CAN(alpha, 0, 0) for a possibly varying alpha).

  **Parameters**

  *   **euler\_basis** (`str`) – Basis string provided to OneQubitEulerDecomposer for 1Q synthesis. Defaults to “U”.
  *   **embodiments** (`Optional`\[`dict`]) – A dictionary mapping interaction strengths alpha to native circuits which embody the gate CAN(alpha, 0, 0). Strengths are taken so that pi/2 represents the class of a full CX.
  *   **backup\_optimizer** (`Optional`\[`Callable`]) – If supplied, defers synthesis to this callable when XXDecomposer has no efficient decomposition of its own. Useful for special cases involving 2 or 3 applications of XX(pi/2), in which case standard synthesis methods provide lower 1Q gate count.

  <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
    If `embodiments` is not passed, or if an entry is missing, it will be populated as needed using the method `_default_embodiment`.

  ## Methods

  ### num\_basis\_gates

  <Function id="qiskit.quantum_info.XXDecomposer.num_basis_gates" signature="XXDecomposer.num_basis_gates(unitary)">
    Counts the number of gates that would be emitted during re-synthesis.

    NOTE: Used by ConsolidateBlocks.
