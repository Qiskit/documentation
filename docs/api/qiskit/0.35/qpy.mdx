# QPY serialization

`qiskit.qpy`

## Using QPY

Using QPY is defined to be straightforward and mirror the user API of the serializers in Python’s standard library, `pickle` and `json`. There are 2 user facing functions: `qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization.dump()` and `qiskit.circuit.qpy_serialization.load()` which are used to dump QPY data to a file object and load circuits from QPY data in a file object respectively. For example:

```python
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.circuit import qpy_serialization

qc = QuantumCircuit(2, name='Bell', metadata={'test': True})
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

with open('bell.qpy', 'wb') as fd:
    qpy_serialization.dump(qc, fd)

with open('bell.qpy', 'rb') as fd:
    new_qc = qpy_serialization.load(fd)[0]
```

| [`dump`](qiskit.qpy.dump "qiskit.qpy.dump")(circuits, file\_obj\[, metadata\_serializer]) | Write QPY binary data to a file |

### QPY Compatibility

The QPY format is designed to be backwards compatible moving forward. This means you should be able to load a QPY with any newer Qiskit version than the one that generated it. However, loading a QPY file with an older Qiskit version is not supported and may not work.

For example, if you generated a QPY file using qiskit-terra 0.18.1 you could load that QPY file with qiskit-terra 0.19.0 and a hypothetical qiskit-terra 0.29.0. However, loading that QPY file with 0.18.0 is not supported and may not work.

## QPY Format

The QPY serialization format is a portable cross-platform binary serialization format for [`QuantumCircuit`](qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") objects in Qiskit. The basic file format is as follows:

A QPY file (or memory object) always starts with the following 7 byte UTF8 string: `QISKIT` which is immediately followed by the overall file header. The contents of the file header as defined as a C struct are:

```c
struct {
    uint8_t qpy_version;
    uint8_t qiskit_major_version;
    uint8_t qiskit_minor_version;
    uint8_t qiskit_patch_version;
    uint64_t num_circuits;
}
```

All values use network byte order <span id="id1" />[1](#f1) (big endian) for cross platform compatibility.

The file header is immediately followed by the circuit payloads. Each individual circuit is composed of the following parts:

`HEADER | METADATA | REGISTERS | CUSTOM_DEFINITIONS | INSTRUCTIONS`

There is a circuit payload for each circuit (where the total number is dictated by `num_circuits` in the file header). There is no padding between the circuits in the data.

<span id="qpy-version-4" />

### Version 4

Version 4 is identical to [Version 3](#qpy-version-3) except that it adds 2 new type strings to the INSTRUCTION\_PARAM struct, `z` to represent `None` (which is encoded as no data), `q` to represent a [`QuantumCircuit`](qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") (which is encoded as a QPY circuit), `r` to represent a `range` of integers (which is encoded as a [RANGE](#qpy-range-pack)), and `t` to represent a `sequence` (which is encoded as defined by [SEQUENCE](#qpy-sequence)). Additionally, version 4 changes the type of register index mapping array from `uint32_t` to `int64_t`. If the values of any of the array elements are negative they represent a register bit that is not present in the circuit.

The [REGISTERS](#qpy-registers) header format has also been updated to

```c
struct {
    char type;
    _Bool standalone;
    uint32_t size;
    uint16_t name_size;
    _bool in_circuit;
}
```

which just adds the `in_circuit` field which represents whether the register is part of the circuit or not.

<span id="qpy-range-pack" />

#### RANGE

A RANGE is a representation of a `range` object. It is defined as:

```c
struct {
    int64_t start;
    int64_t stop;
    int64_t step;
}
```

<span id="qpy-sequence" />

#### SEQUENCE

A SEQUENCE is a reprentation of a arbitrary sequence object. As sequence are just fixed length containers of arbitrary python objects their QPY can’t fully represent any sequence, but as long as the contents in a sequence are other QPY serializable types for the INSTRUCTION\_PARAM payload the `sequence` object can be serialized.

A sequence instruction parameter starts with a header defined as:

```c
struct {
    uint64_t size;
}
```

followed by `size` elements that are INSTRUCTION\_PARAM payloads, where each of these define an element in the sequence. The sequence object will be typecasted into proper type, e.g. `tuple`, afterwards.

<span id="qpy-version-3" />

### Version 3

Version 3 of the QPY format is identical to [Version 2](#qpy-version-2) except that it defines a struct format to represent a [`PauliEvolutionGate`](qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate "qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate") natively in QPY. To accomplish this the [CUSTOM\_DEFINITIONS](#qpy-custom-definition) struct now supports a new type value `'p'` to represent a [`PauliEvolutionGate`](qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate "qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate"). Enties in the custom instructions tables have unique name generated that start with the string `"###PauliEvolutionGate_"` followed by a uuid string. This gate name is reservered in QPY and if you have a custom [`Instruction`](qiskit.circuit.Instruction "qiskit.circuit.Instruction") object with a definition set and that name prefix it will error. If it’s of type `'p'` the data payload is defined as follows:

<span id="pauli-evolution" />

<span id="pauli-evo-qpy" />

#### PAULI\_EVOLUTION

This represents the high level [`PauliEvolutionGate`](qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate "qiskit.circuit.library.PauliEvolutionGate")

```c
struct {
    uint64_t operator_count;
    _Bool standalone_op;
    char time_type;
    uint64_t time_size;
    uint64_t synthesis_size;
}
```

This is immediately followed by `operator_count` elements defined by the [SPARSE\_PAULI\_OP\_LIST\_ELEM](#qpy-pauli-sum-op) payload. Following that we have `time_size` bytes representing the `time` attribute. If `standalone_op` is `True` then there must only be a single operator. The encoding of these bytes is determined by the value of `time_type`. Possible values of `time_type` are `'f'`, `'p'`, and `'e'`. If `time_type` is `'f'` it’s a double, `'p'` defines a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") object which is represented by a [PARAMETER](#qpy-param-struct), `e` defines a [`ParameterExpression`](qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression "qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression") object (that’s not a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter")) which is represented by a [PARAMETER\_EXPR](#qpy-param-expr). Following that is `synthesis_size` bytes which is a utf8 encoded json payload representing the [`EvolutionSynthesis`](qiskit.synthesis.EvolutionSynthesis "qiskit.synthesis.EvolutionSynthesis") class used by the gate.

<span id="sparse-pauli-op-list-elem" />

<span id="qpy-pauli-sum-op" />

#### SPARSE\_PAULI\_OP\_LIST\_ELEM

This represents an instance of [`PauliSumOp`](qiskit.opflow.primitive_ops.PauliSumOp "qiskit.opflow.primitive_ops.PauliSumOp").

```c
struct {
    uint32_t pauli_op_size;
}
```

which is immediately followed by `pauli_op_size` bytes which are .npy format <span id="id2" />[2](#f2) data which represents the [`SparsePauliOp`](qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp "qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp").

Version 3 of the QPY format also defines a struct format to represent a `ParameterVectorElement` as a distinct subclass from a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter"). This adds a new parameter type char `'v'` to represent a `ParameterVectorElement` which is now supported as a type string value for an INSTRUCTION\_PARAM. The payload for these parameters are defined below as [PARAMETER\_VECTOR\_ELEMENT](#qpy-param-vector).

<span id="parameter-vector-element" />

<span id="qpy-param-vector" />

#### PARAMETER\_VECTOR\_ELEMENT

A PARAMETER\_VECTOR\_ELEMENT represents a `ParameterVectorElement` object the data for a INSTRUCTION\_PARAM. The contents of the PARAMETER\_VECTOR\_ELEMENT are defined as:

```c
struct {
    uint16_t vector_name_size;
    uint64_t vector_size;
    char uuid[16];
    uint64_t index;
}
```

which is immediately followed by `vector_name_size` utf8 bytes representing the parameter’s vector name.

<span id="parameter-expr" />

<span id="qpy-param-expr-v3" />

#### PARAMETER\_EXPR

Additionally, since QPY format version v3 distinguishes between a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") and `ParameterVectorElement` the payload for a [`ParameterExpression`](qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression "qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression") needs to be updated to distinguish between the types. The following is the modified payload format which is mostly identical to the format in Version 1 and [Version 2](#qpy-version-2) but just modifies the `map_elements` struct to include a symbol type field.

A PARAMETER\_EXPR represents a [`ParameterExpression`](qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression "qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression") object that the data for an INSTRUCTION\_PARAM. The contents of a PARAMETER\_EXPR are defined as:

```c
struct {
    uint64_t map_elements;
    uint64_t expr_size;
}
```

Immediately following the header is `expr_size` bytes of utf8 data containing the expression string, which is the sympy srepr of the expression for the parameter expression. Following that is a symbol map which contains `map_elements` elements with the format

```c
struct {
    char symbol_type;
    char type;
    uint64_t size;
}
```

The `symbol_type` key determines the payload type of the symbol representation for the element. If it’s `p` it represents a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") and if it’s `v` it represents a `ParameterVectorElement`. The map element struct is immediately followed by the symbol map key payload, if `symbol_type` is `p` then it is followed immediately by a [PARAMETER](#qpy-param-struct) object (both the struct and utf8 name bytes) and if `symbol_type` is `v` then the struct is imediately followed by [PARAMETER\_VECTOR\_ELEMENT](#qpy-param-vector) (both the struct and utf8 name bytes). That is followed by `size` bytes for the data of the symbol. The data format is dependent on the value of `type`. If `type` is `p` then it represents a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") and size will be 0, the value will just be the same as the key. Similarly if the `type` is `v` then it represents a `ParameterVectorElement` and size will be 0 as the value will just be the same as the key. If `type` is `f` then it represents a double precision float. If `type` is `c` it represents a double precision complex, which is represented by the [COMPLEX](#qpy-complex). Finally, if type is `i` it represents an integer which is an `int64_t`.

<span id="qpy-version-2" />

### Version 2

Version 2 of the QPY format is identical to version 1 except for the HEADER section is slightly different. You can refer to the [Version 1](#qpy-version-1) section for the details on the rest of the payload format.

#### HEADER

The contents of HEADER are defined as a C struct are:

```c
struct {
    uint16_t name_size;
    char global_phase_type;
    uint16_t global_phase_size;
    uint32_t num_qubits;
    uint32_t num_clbits;
    uint64_t metadata_size;
    uint32_t num_registers;
    uint64_t num_instructions;
    uint64_t num_custom_gates;
}
```

This is immediately followed by `name_size` bytes of utf8 data for the name of the circuit. Following this is immediately `global_phase_size` bytes representing the global phase. The content of that data is dictated by the value of `global_phase_type`. If it’s `'f'` the data is a float and is the size of a `double`. If it’s `'p'` defines a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") object which is represented by a PARAM struct (see below), `e` defines a [`ParameterExpression`](qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression "qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression") object (that’s not a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter")) which is represented by a PARAM\_EXPR struct (see below).

<span id="qpy-version-1" />

### Version 1

<span id="id3" />

#### HEADER

The contents of HEADER as defined as a C struct are:

```c
struct {
    uint16_t name_size;
    double global_phase;
    uint32_t num_qubits;
    uint32_t num_clbits;
    uint64_t metadata_size;
    uint32_t num_registers;
    uint64_t num_instructions;
    uint64_t num_custom_gates;
}
```

This is immediately followed by `name_size` bytes of utf8 data for the name of the circuit.

#### METADATA

The METADATA field is a UTF8 encoded JSON string. After reading the HEADER (which is a fixed size at the start of the QPY file) and the `name` string you then read the `metadata_size` number of bytes and parse the JSON to get the metadata for the circuit.

<span id="qpy-registers" />

#### REGISTERS

The contents of REGISTERS is a number of REGISTER object. If num\_registers is > 0 then after reading METADATA you read that number of REGISTER structs defined as:

```c
struct {
    char type;
    _Bool standalone;
    uint32_t size;
    uint16_t name_size;
}
```

`type` can be `'q'` or `'c'`.

Immediately following the REGISTER struct is the utf8 encoded register name of size `name_size`. After the `name` utf8 bytes there is then an array of int64\_t values of size `size` that contains a map of the register’s index to the circuit’s qubit index. For example, array element 0’s value is the index of the `register[0]`’s position in the containing circuit’s qubits list.

<Admonition title="Note" type="note">
  Prior to QPY [Version 4](#qpy-version-4) the type of array elements was uint32\_t. This was changed to enable negative values which represent bits in the array not present in the circuit
</Admonition>

The standalone boolean determines whether the register is constructed as a standalone register that was added to the circuit or was created from existing bits. A register is considered standalone if it has bits constructed solely as part of it, for example:

```python
qr = QuantumRegister(2)
qc = QuantumCircuit(qr)
```

the register `qr` would be a standalone register. While something like:

```python
bits = [Qubit(), Qubit()]
qr = QuantumRegister(bits=bits)
qc = QuantumCircuit(bits=bits)
```

`qr` would have `standalone` set to `False`.

<span id="custom-definitions" />

<span id="qpy-custom-definition" />

#### CUSTOM\_DEFINITIONS

This section specifies custom definitions for any of the instructions in the circuit.

CUSTOM\_DEFINITION\_HEADER contents are defined as:

```c
struct {
    uint64_t size;
}
```

If size is greater than 0 that means the circuit contains custom instruction(s). Each custom instruction is defined with a CUSTOM\_INSTRUCTION block defined as:

```c
struct {
    uint16_t name_size;
    char type;
    _Bool custom_definition;
    uint64_t size;
}
```

Immediately following the CUSTOM\_INSTRUCTION struct is the utf8 encoded name of size `name_size`.

If `custom_definition` is `True` that means that the immediately following `size` bytes contains a QPY circuit data which can be used for the custom definition of that gate. If `custom_definition` is `False` then the instruction can be considered opaque (ie no definition). The `type` field determines what type of object will get created with the custom definition. If it’s `'g'` it will be a [`Gate`](qiskit.circuit.Gate "qiskit.circuit.Gate") object, `'i'` it will be a [`Instruction`](qiskit.circuit.Instruction "qiskit.circuit.Instruction") object.

#### INSTRUCTIONS

The contents of INSTRUCTIONS is a list of INSTRUCTION metadata objects

```c
struct {
    uint16_t name_size;
    uint16_t label_size;
    uint16_t num_parameters;
    uint32_t num_qargs;
    uint32_t num_cargs;
    _Bool has_conditional;
    uint16_t conditional_reg_name_size;
    int64_t conditional_value;
}
```

This metadata object is immediately followed by `name_size` bytes of utf8 bytes for the `name`. `name` here is the Qiskit class name for the Instruction class if it’s defined in Qiskit. Otherwise it falls back to the custom instruction name. Following the `name` bytes there are `label_size` bytes of utf8 data for the label if one was set on the instruction. Following the label bytes if `has_conditional` is `True` then there are `conditional_reg_name_size` bytes of utf8 data for the name of the conditional register name. In case of single classical bit conditions the register name utf8 data will be prefixed with a null character “x00” and then a utf8 string integer representing the classical bit index in the circuit that the condition is on.

This is immediately followed by the INSTRUCTION\_ARG structs for the list of arguments of that instruction. These are in the order of all quantum arguments (there are num\_qargs of these) followed by all classical arguments (num\_cargs of these).

The contents of each INSTRUCTION\_ARG is:

```c
struct {
    char type;
    uint32_t index;
}
```

`type` can be `'q'` or `'c'`.

After all arguments for an instruction the parameters are specified with `num_parameters` INSTRUCTION\_PARAM structs.

The contents of each INSTRUCTION\_PARAM is:

```c
struct {
    char type;
    uint64_t size;
}
```

After each INSTRUCTION\_PARAM the next `size` bytes are the parameter’s data. The `type` field can be `'i'`, `'f'`, `'p'`, `'e'`, `'s'`, `'c'` or `'n'` which dictate the format. For `'i'` it’s an integer, `'f'` it’s a double, `'s'` if it’s a string (encoded as utf8), `'c'` is a complex and the data is represented by the struct format in the [PARAMETER\_EXPR](#qpy-param-expr) section. `'p'` defines a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") object which is represented by a [PARAMETER](#qpy-param-struct) struct, `e` defines a [`ParameterExpression`](qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression "qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression") object (that’s not a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter")) which is represented by a [PARAMETER\_EXPR](#qpy-param-expr) struct (on QPY format [Version 3](#qpy-version-3) the format is tweak slightly see: [PARAMETER\_EXPR](#qpy-param-expr-v3)), `'n'` represents an object from numpy (either an `ndarray` or a numpy type) which means the data is .npy format <span id="id4" />[2](#f2) data, and in QPY [Version 3](#qpy-version-3) `'v'` represents a `ParameterVectorElement` which is represented by a [PARAMETER\_VECTOR\_ELEMENT](#qpy-param-vector) struct.

<span id="qpy-param-struct" />

#### PARAMETER

A PARAMETER represents a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") object the data for a INSTRUCTION\_PARAM. The contents of the PARAMETER are defined as:

```c
struct {
    uint16_t name_size;
    char uuid[16];
}
```

which is immediately followed by `name_size` utf8 bytes representing the parameter name.

<span id="qpy-param-expr" />

<span id="id5" />

#### PARAMETER\_EXPR

A PARAMETER\_EXPR represents a [`ParameterExpression`](qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression "qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression") object that the data for an INSTRUCTION\_PARAM. The contents of a PARAMETER\_EXPR are defined as:

The PARAMETER\_EXPR data starts with a header:

```c
struct {
    uint64_t map_elements;
    uint64_t expr_size;
}
```

Immediately following the header is `expr_size` bytes of utf8 data containing the expression string, which is the sympy srepr of the expression for the parameter expression. Follwing that is a symbol map which contains `map_elements` elements with the format

```c
struct {
    char type;
    uint64_t size;
}
```

Which is followed immediately by `PARAMETER` object (both the struct and utf8 name bytes) for the symbol map key. That is followed by `size` bytes for the data of the symbol. The data format is dependent on the value of `type`. If `type` is `p` then it represents a [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") and size will be 0, the value will just be the same as the key. If `type` is `f` then it represents a double precision float. If `type` is `c` it represents a double precision complex, which is represented by [COMPLEX](#qpy-complex). Finally, if type is `i` it represents an integer which is an `int64_t`.

<span id="qpy-complex" />

#### COMPLEX

When representing a double precision complex value in QPY the following struct is used:

```c
struct {
    double real;
    double imag;
}
```

this matches the internal C representation of Python’s complex type. <span id="id6" />[3](#f3)
