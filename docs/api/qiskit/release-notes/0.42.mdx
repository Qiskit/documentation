#### Prelude

Qiskit Terra 0.23.3 is a minor bugfix release.

<span id="release-notes-terra-0-23-3-bug-fixes" />

<span id="id44" />

#### Bug Fixes

*   Fixes a bug in the [`Optimize1qGatesDecomposition`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.transpiler.passes.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition "qiskit.transpiler.passes.Optimize1qGatesDecomposition") transformation pass where the score for substitutions was wrongly calculated when the gate errors are zero.

*   The method [`ECRGate.inverse()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.ECRGate#inverse "qiskit.circuit.library.ECRGate.inverse") now returns another [`ECRGate`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.ECRGate "qiskit.circuit.library.ECRGate") instance rather than a custom gate, since it is self inverse.

*   Clip probabilities in the `QuantumState.probabilities()` and `QuantumState.probabilities_dict()` methods to the interval `[0, 1]`. This fixes roundoff errors where probabilities could e.g. be larger than 1, leading to errors in the shot emulation of the sampler. Fixed [#9761](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/9761).

*   Fixed a bug in the [`BackendSampler`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.primitives.BackendSampler "qiskit.primitives.BackendSampler") where the binary probability bitstrings were truncated to the minimal number of bits required to represent the largest outcome as integer. That means that if e.g. `{"0001": 1.0}` was measured, the result was truncated to `{"1": 1.0}`.

*   Fixed an issue with the [`PassManagerConfig.from_backend()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.transpiler.PassManagerConfig#from_backend "qiskit.transpiler.PassManagerConfig.from_backend") constructor method when it was used with a [`BackendV1`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.BackendV1 "qiskit.providers.BackendV1") based simulator backend. For some simulator backends which did not populate some optional fields the constructor would error. Fixed [#9265](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/9265) and [#8546](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/8546)

*   Fixed the [`BackendSampler`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.primitives.BackendSampler "qiskit.primitives.BackendSampler") and [`BackendEstimator`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.primitives.BackendEstimator "qiskit.primitives.BackendEstimator") to run successfully with a custom `bound_pass_manager`. Previously, the execution for single circuits with a `bound_pass_manager` would raise a `ValueError` because a list was not returned in one of the steps.

*   The [`GateDirection`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.transpiler.passes.GateDirection "qiskit.transpiler.passes.GateDirection") transpiler pass will no longer reject gates that have been given explicit calibrations, but do not exist in the generic coupling map or target.

*   Fixed an issue with the [`CommutationChecker`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.CommutationChecker "qiskit.circuit.CommutationChecker") class where it would attempt to internally allocate an array for $2^{n}$ qubits when it only needed an array to represent $n$ qubits. This could cause an excessive amount of memory for wide gates, for example a 4 qubit gate would require 32 gigabytes instead of 2 kilobytes. Fixed [#9197](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/9197)

*   Getting empty calibration from [`InstructionProperties`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.transpiler.InstructionProperties "qiskit.transpiler.InstructionProperties") raises AttributeError has been fixed. Now it returns `None`.

*   Fixed [`qasm()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#qasm "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.qasm") so that it appends `;` after `reset` instruction.

*   Register and parameter names will now be escaped during the OpenQASM 3 export ([`qasm3.dumps()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qasm3#qiskit.qasm3.dumps "qiskit.qasm3.dumps")) if they are not already valid identifiers. Fixed [#9658](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/9658).

*   QPY (using [`qpy.load()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qpy#qiskit.qpy.load "qiskit.qpy.load")) will now correctly deserialize [`StatePreparation`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.StatePreparation "qiskit.circuit.library.StatePreparation") instructions. Previously, QPY would error when attempting to load a file containing one. Fixed [#8297](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/8297).

*   Fixed a bug in [`random_circuit()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/circuit#qiskit.circuit.random.random_circuit "qiskit.circuit.random.random_circuit") with 64 or more qubits and `conditional=True`, where the resulting circuit could have an incorrectly typed value in its condition, causing a variety of failures during transpilation or other circuit operations. Fixed [#9649](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/9649).

*   Fixed an issue with the [`OneQubitEulerDecomposer`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer "qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer") class’s methods [`angles()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer#angles "qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer.angles") and [`angles_and_phase()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer#angles_and_phase "qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer.angles_and_phase") would error if the input matrix was of a dtype other than `complex`/`np.cdouble`. In earlier releases this worked fine but this stopped working in Qiskit Terra 0.23.0 when the internals of [`OneQubitEulerDecomposer`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer "qiskit.quantum_info.OneQubitEulerDecomposer") were re-written in Rust. Fixed [#9827](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/9827)

*   The Qiskit gates [`CCZGate`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.CCZGate "qiskit.circuit.library.CCZGate"), [`CSGate`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.CSGate "qiskit.circuit.library.CSGate"), [`CSdgGate`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.CSdgGate "qiskit.circuit.library.CSdgGate") are not defined in `qelib1.inc` and, therefore, when dump as OpenQASM 2.0, their definition should be inserted in the file. Fixes [#9559](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/9559), [#9721](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/9721), and [#9722](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/issues/9722).

### Aer 0.12.0

<span id="release-notes-0-12-0-aer-prelude" />

<span id="id48" />

#### Prelude

The Qiskit Aer 0.12.0 release highlights are:

> *   Added a new GPU tensor network simulator based on [cuTensorNet](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/cutensornet/index.html)
> *   Added a new `AerDensityMatrix` class to the [`qiskit_aer.quantum_info`](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/apidocs/aer_quantum_info.html#module-qiskit_aer.quantum_info "(in Qiskit Aer v0.13.0)") module
> *   Greatly improving the runtime performance of the `AerSimulator` and the legacy `QasmSimulator`, `StatevectorSimulator`, and `UnitarySimulator` classes by directly converting the input [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") objects to an internal C++ representation instead of first serializing the circuit to a [`QasmQobj`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj "qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj"). This improvement will be most noticeable for circuits with a small number of qubits or parameterized circuits using the `parameter_binds` keyword argument.

<span id="release-notes-0-12-0-aer-new-features" />

<span id="id49" />

#### New Features

*   Added a new class method `from_backend_properties()` to the `NoiseModel`. This enables constructing a new `NoiseModel` from a `BackendProperties` object. Similar functionality used to be present in the `NoiseModel.from_backend()` constructor, however it was removed since a `BackendProperties` object alone doesn’t contain sufficient information to create a `NoiseModel` object.

*   Added a new class, `AerDensityMatrix`, to the [`qiskit_aer.quantum_info`](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/apidocs/aer_quantum_info.html#module-qiskit_aer.quantum_info "(in Qiskit Aer v0.13.0)") module. This class is used to provide the same interface to the upstream [`DensityMatrix`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix "qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix") class in Qiskit but backed by Qiskit Aer’s simulation.

*   Added a new keyword argument, `abelian_grouping`, to the [`Estimator`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.primitives.Estimator "qiskit.primitives.Estimator"). This argument is used to control whether the [`Estimator`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.primitives.Estimator "qiskit.primitives.Estimator") will group the input observables into qubit-wise commutable observables which reduces the number of circuit executions required to compute the expectation value and improves the runtime performance of the [`Estimator`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.primitives.Estimator "qiskit.primitives.Estimator"). By default this is set to `True`.

*   `AerState` has a new method `initialize_density_matrix()` that sets a density matrix to `AER::QV::DensityMatrix`. This method will be called in `q.i.states.DensityMatrix` to initialize its data with `ndarray`. `initialize_density_matrix()` has a boolean argument that specifies copy or share of `ndarray` data. If the data is shared with C++ and python, the data must not be collected in python while C++ accesses it.

*   The overhead for running simulations with `run()` (for all simulator backend classess) has been greatly reduced. This was accomplished by no longer internally serializing [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") objects into [`QasmQobj`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj "qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj") and instead the [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") object directly to an internal C++ circuit structure used for simulation. This improvement is most noticeable for simulations of circuts with a small number of qubits or parameterized circuits using the `parameter_binds` keyword argument of `run()`. Note that pulse simualation (via the now deprecated `PulseSimulator`) and DASK-based simulation still use the internal serialization and will not see this performance improvement.

*   Added a new method to the `AerJob`, `circuits()`, which returns a list of [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") objects. This method returns `None` if Qobj is used for simulation.

*   `AerState` and `AerStatevector` now support applying [`Kraus`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.Kraus "qiskit.quantum_info.Kraus") operators. In `AerStatevector`, one of the Kraus operators is applied randomly to the quantum state based on the error probabilities.

*   Added a new simulation method based on NVIDIA’s [cuTensorNet](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/cutensornet/index.html) APIs of cuQuantum SDK. This provides a GPU accelerated general tensor network simulator that can simulate any quantum circuit, by internally translating the circuit into a tensor network to perform the simulation. To use this simulation method, set `method="tensor_network"` and `device="GPU"` when initializing an `AerSimulator` object. For example:

    ```python
    from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

    tensor_net_sim = AerSimulator(method="tensor_network", device="GPU")
    ```

    This method supports both statevector and density matrix simulations. Noise simulation can also be done with a density matrix single shot simulation if there are not any `SaveStatevector` operations in the circuit.

    This new simulation method also supports parallelization with multiple GPUs and MPI processes by using tensor network slicing technique. However, this type of simulation will likely take a very long time if the input circuits are complicated.

*   The `BLA_VENDOR` environment variable can now be specified to use a different BLAS library when building Qiskit Aer from source. By default if this is not specified OpenBLAS will be used by default. If the BLAS library specified in BLA\_VENDOR\` can not be found then the Cmake build process will stop.

#### Known Issues

*   This release of Qiskit Aer is not compatible with the Conan 2.X release series. If you are building Qiskit Aer from source manually ensure that you are using a Conan 1.x release. Compatibility with newer versions of Conan will be fixed in a future release. You can refer to issue [#1730](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1730) for more details.

<span id="release-notes-0-12-0-aer-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id51" />

#### Upgrade Notes

*   The default behavior of the [`Estimator`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.primitives.Estimator "qiskit.primitives.Estimator") primitive will now group the input observable into qubit-wise commutable observables. The grouping reduces the number of circuits to be executed and improves the performance. If you desire the previous behavior you can initialize your [`Estimator`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.primitives.Estimator "qiskit.primitives.Estimator") instance with the keyword argument `abelian_grouping=False`.

*   Removed the usage of primitives with the context manager and the initialization with circuits, (observables only for Estimator), and parameters which has been deprecated in the Qiskit Terra 0.22.0 release in October 2022.

*   The behavior of `run()` method has changed when invalid or otherwise unsimulatable [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") objects are passed as an input. Previously, in these cases the `run()` method would return an `AerJob` whose `result()` method would return a [`Result`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.result.Result "qiskit.result.Result") with the `ERROR` or `PARTIAL COMPLETED` (depending on whether all the circuit inputs or only some were invalid or not). Starting in this release instead of returning a result object with these statuses an exception will be raised instead. This change was necessary because of the performance improvements by no longer internally serializing the [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") objects to a Qobj before passing it to C++, instead the direct conversion from [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") now errors directly when trying to simulate a circuit Qiskit Aer is unable to execute. If you desire the previous behavior you can build Qiskit Aer in standalone mode and manually serialize your [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") objects to a JSON representation of the [`QasmQobj`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj "qiskit.qobj.QasmQobj") which you then pass to the standalone Aer binary which will retain the previous behavior.

*   A deprecated method `add_nonlocal_quantum_error()` in `NoiseModel` has been removed. No alternative method is available. If you want to add non-local quantum errors, you should write a transpiler pass that inserts your own quantum error into a circuit, and run the pass just before running the circuit on Aer simulator.

*   The `NoiseModel.from_backend()` now has changed not to accept `BackendProperties` object as a `backend` argument. Use newly added `NoiseModel.from_backend_properties()` method instead.

*   A deprecated `standard_gates` argument broadly used in several methods and functions (listed below) across `noise` module has been removed.

    *   `NoiseModel.from_backend()` and `noise.device.basic_device_gate_errors()`
    *   `kraus_error()`, `mixed_unitary_error()`, `pauli_error()` and `depolarizing_error()` in `noise.errors.standard_errors`
    *   `QuantumError.__init__()`

    No alternative means are available because the user should be agnostic about how the simulator represents noises (quantum errors) internally.

*   The constructor of `QuantumError` has now dropped the support of deprecated json-like input for `noise_ops` argument. Use the new styple input for `noise_ops` argument instead, for example,

    ```python
    from qiskit.circuit.library import IGate, XGate
    from qiskit_aer.noise import QuantumError

    error = QuantumError([
        ((IGate(), [1]), 0.9),
        ((XGate(), [1]), 0.1),
    ])

    # json-like input is no longer accepted (the following code fails)
    #  error = QuantumError([
    #      ([{"name": "I", "qubits": [1]}], 0.9),
    #      ([{"name": "X", "qubits": [1]}], 0.1),
    #  ])
    ```

    Also it has dropped deprecated arguments:

    *   `number_of_qubits`: Use `QuantumCircuit` to define `noise_ops` instead.
    *   `atol`: Use `QuantumError.atol` attribute instead.
    *   `standard_gates`: No alternative is available (users should not too much care about internal representation of quantum errors).

*   The deprecated `noise.errors.errorutils` module has been entirely removed and no alternatives are available. All functions in the module were helper functions meant to be used only for implementing functions in `standard_errors` (i.e. they should have been provided as private functions) and no longer used in it.

*   The deprecated `utils.noise_remapper` have been entirely removed and no alternatives are available since the C++ code now automatically truncates and remaps noise models if it truncates circuits.

*   All deprecated functions (`pauli_operators()` and `reset_operators()`) and class (`NoiseTransformer`) in `utils.noise_transformation` module have been removed, and no alternatives are available. They were in fact private functions/class used only for implementing `approximate_quantum_error()` and should not have been public.

*   The previously deprecated `qobj` argument name of the `AerSimulator` and `PulseSimulator` classes’ `run()` method has now been removed. This argument name was deprecated as part of the Qiskit Aer 0.8.0 release and has been by the `circuits` and `schedules` argument name respectively.

*   Aer’s `setup.py` has been updated to no longer attempt to make calls to `pip` to install build requirements, both manually and via the `setup_requires` option in `setuptools.setup`. The preferred way to build Aer is to use a [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/)-compatible builder such as:

    ```python
    pip install .
    ```

    This change means that a direct call to `setup.py` will no longer work if the build requirements are not installed. This is inline with modern Python packaging guidelines.

<span id="release-notes-0-12-0-aer-deprecation-notes" />

<span id="id52" />

#### Deprecation Notes

*   Support for running Qiskit Aer with Python 3.7 support has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This means starting in a future release you will need to upgrade the Python version you’re using to Python 3.8 or above.

*   The `PulseSimulator` backend has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you’re using the `PulseSimulator` backend to perform pulse level simulation, instead you should use the [Qiskit Dynamics](https://qiskit.org/documentation/dynamics/) library instead to perform the simulation. Qiskit Dynamics provides a more flexible and robust pulse level simulation framework than the `PulseSimulator` backend.

*   The `qobj()` method of the `AerJob` class is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The use of the qobj format as input to `run()` has been deprecated since qiskit-aer 0.9.0 and in most cases this method would return `None` now anyway. If you’d like to get the input to the `run()` method now you can use the `circuits()` method instead, which will return the [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") objects that were simulated in the job.

*   A `warnings` argument broadly used in several methods and functions across `noise` module has been deprecated in favor of the use of filtering functions in Python’s standard `warnings` library.

<span id="release-notes-0-12-0-aer-bug-fixes" />

<span id="id53" />

#### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed an issue when creating a new `AerStatevector` instance from a `numpy.ndarray` that had non-contiguous memory. Previously, this would result in unexpected behavior (and a potential error) as the `AerStatevector` assumed the input array was contiguous. This has been fixed so that memory layout is checked and the `numpy.ndarray` will be copied internally as a contiguous array before using it.

*   Fixed an issue with the [`Sampler`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.primitives.Sampler "qiskit.primitives.Sampler") class where it would previously fail if the input [`QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") contained multiple multiple classical registers. Fixed [#1679](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1679)

*   The bits count of classical register used on the GPU was not set before calculating free available memory for chunks that causes infinite loop. So this fix set bits count before allocating chunks if batch shots execution is enabled.

*   Fix build errors and test errors when enabling GPU but disabling cuQuantum.

*   Fixed an issue in the matrix product state simulation method (i.e. setting the keyword argument `method="matrix_product_state"` when initializing an `AerSimulator` object) where the simulator would incorrectly sort the qubits prior to performing measurment potentially resulting in an infinite loop. This has been fixed so the measurement of the qubits occurs in the order of the current MPS structure and then sorting afterwards as a post-processing step. This also will likely improve the performance of the simulation method and enable more accurate representation of entangled states. Fixed [#1694](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1694)

*   The `AerSimulator` backend with methods:

    *   `statevector`
    *   `density_matrix`
    *   `matrix_product_state`
    *   `stabilizer`

    now report that they support `break_loop` and `continue_loop` instructions when used as backends for the Terra [`transpile()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/compiler#qiskit.compiler.transpile "qiskit.compiler.transpile") function. The simulators already did support these, but had just not been reporting it.

### IBM Q Provider 0.20.2

This release removes the overly restrictive version constraints set in the requirements for the package added in 0.20.1. For the 0.20.1 the only dependency that was intended to have a version cap was the `requests-ntlm` package as its new release was the only dependency which currently has an incompatibility with `qiskit-ibmq-provider`. The other version caps which were added as part of 0.20.1 were causing installation issues in several environments because it made the `qiskit-ibmq-provider` package incompatible with the dependency versions used in other packages.
