### IBM Q Provider 0.14.0

<span id="release-notes-ibmq-0-14-0-new-features" />

<span id="id257" />

#### New Features

*   You can now use the `qiskit.providers.ibmq.runtime.RuntimeJob.logs()` method to retrieve job logs. Note that logs are only available after the job finishes.

*   A new backend configuration attribute `input_allowed` now tells you the types of input supported by the backend. Valid input types are `job`, which means circuit jobs, and `runtime`, which means Qiskit Runtime.

    You can also use `input_allowed` in backend filtering. For example:

    ```python
    from qiskit import IBMQ

    provider = IBMQ.load_account()
    # Get a list of all backends that support runtime.
    runtime_backends = provider.backends(input_allowed='runtime')
    ```

<span id="release-notes-ibmq-0-14-0-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id258" />

#### Upgrade Notes

*   `qiskit-ibmq-provider` now uses a new package `websocket-client` as its websocket client, and packages `websockets` and `nest-asyncio` are no longer required. `setup.py` and `requirements.txt` have been updated accordingly.

<span id="release-notes-ibmq-0-14-0-bug-fixes" />

<span id="id259" />

#### Bug Fixes

*   Fixes the issue that uses `shots=1` instead of the documented default when no `shots` is specified for `run_circuits()`.

*   Fixes the issue wherein a `QiskitBackendNotFoundError` exception is raised when retrieving a runtime job that was submitted using a different provider than the one used for retrieval.

*   Streaming runtime program interim results with proxies is now supported. You can specify the proxies to use when enabling the account as usual, for example:

    ```python
    from qiskit import IBMQ

    proxies = {'urls': {'https://127.0.0.1:8085'}}
    provider = IBMQ.enable_account(API_TOKEN, proxies=proxies)
    ```
