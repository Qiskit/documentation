<span id="ignis-0-3-3" />

### Ignis 0.3.3

<span id="release-notes-0-3-3-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id446" />

#### Upgrade Notes

*   A new requirement [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) has been added to the requirements list. This dependency was added in the 0.3.0 release but wasn’t properly exposed as a dependency in that release. This would lead to an `ImportError` if the `qiskit.ignis.measurement.discriminator.iq_discriminators` module was imported. This is now correctly listed as a dependency so that `scikit-learn` will be installed with qiskit-ignis.

<span id="release-notes-0-3-3-bug-fixes" />

<span id="id447" />

#### Bug Fixes

*   Fixes an issue in qiskit-ignis 0.3.2 which would raise an `ImportError` when `qiskit.ignis.verification.tomography.fitters.process_fitter` was imported without `cvxpy` being installed.

<span id="id449" />

### Aer 0.5.2

No Change

<span id="ignis-0-3-2" />

### Ignis 0.3.2

<span id="id450" />

#### Bug Fixes

*   The `qiskit.ignis.verification.TomographyFitter.fit()` method has improved detection logic for the default fitter. Previously, the `cvx` fitter method was used whenever [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/) was installed. However, it was possible to install cvxpy without an SDP solver that would work for the `cvx` fitter method. This logic has been reworked so that the `cvx` fitter method is only used if `cvxpy` is installed and an SDP solver is present that can be used. Otherwise, the `lstsq` fitter is used.
*   Fixes an edge case in `qiskit.ignis.mitigation.measurement.fitters.MeasurementFitter.apply()` for input that has invalid or incorrect state labels that don’t match the calibration circuit. Previously, this would not error and just return an empty result. Instead now this case is correctly caught and a `QiskitError` exception is raised when using incorrect labels.

<span id="id451" />

### Aqua 0.7.3

<span id="release-notes-0-7-3-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id452" />

#### Upgrade Notes

*   The [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/) dependency which is required for the svm classifier has been removed from the requirements list and made an optional dependency. This is because installing cvxpy is not seamless in every environment and often requires a compiler be installed to run. To use the svm classifier now you’ll need to install cvxpy by either running `pip install cvxpy<1.1.0` or to install it with aqua running `pip install qiskit-aqua[cvx]`.

<span id="release-notes-0-7-3-bug-fixes" />

<span id="id453" />

#### Bug Fixes

*   The `compose` method of the `CircuitOp` used `QuantumCircuit.combine` which has been changed to use `QuantumCircuit.compose`. Using combine leads to the problem that composing an operator with a `CircuitOp` based on a named register does not chain the operators but stacks them. E.g. composing `Z ^ 2` with a circuit based on a 2-qubit named register yielded a 4-qubit operator instead of a 2-qubit operator.
*   The `MatrixOp.to_instruction` method previously returned an operator and not an instruction. This method has been updated to return an Instruction. Note that this only works if the operator primitive is unitary, otherwise an error is raised upon the construction of the instruction.
*   The `__hash__` method of the `PauliOp` class used the `id()` method which prevents set comparisons to work as expected since they rely on hash tables and identical objects used to not have identical hashes. Now, the implementation uses a hash of the string representation inline with the implementation in the `Pauli` class.

<span id="id454" />

### IBM Q Provider 0.7.2

No Change

<span id="qiskit-0-19-4" />
## 0.19.4

<span id="id455" />

### Terra 0.14.2

<span id="release-notes-0-14-2-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id456" />

#### Upgrade Notes

*   The `circuit_to_gate` and `circuit_to_instruction` converters had previously automatically included the generated gate or instruction in the active `SessionEquivalenceLibrary`. These converters now accept an optional `equivalence_library` keyword argument to specify if and where the converted instances should be registered. The default behavior is not to register the converted instance.

<span id="release-notes-0-14-2-bug-fixes" />

<span id="id457" />

#### Bug Fixes

*   Implementations of the multi-controlled X Gate (`MCXGrayCode`, `MCXRecursive` and `MCXVChain`) have had their `name` properties changed to more accurately describe their implementation (`mcx_gray`, `mcx_recursive`, and `mcx_vchain` respectively.) Previously, these gates shared the name ```mcx` with ``MCXGate```, which caused these gates to be incorrectly transpiled and simulated.
*   `ControlledGate` instances with a set `ctrl_state` were in some cases not being evaluated as equal, even if the compared gates were equivalent. This has been resolved.
*   Fixed the SI unit conversion for `qiskit.pulse.SetFrequency`. The `SetFrequency` instruction should be in Hz on the frontend and has to be converted to GHz when `SetFrequency` is converted to `PulseQobjInstruction`.
*   Open controls were implemented by modifying a gate's definition. However, when the gate already exists in the basis, this definition is not used, which yields incorrect circuits sent to a backend. This modifies the unroller to output the definition if it encounters a controlled gate with open controls.

<span id="id458" />

### Aer 0.5.2

No Change

<span id="ignis-0-3-0" />

### Ignis 0.3.0

No Change

<span id="aqua-0-7-2" />

### Aqua 0.7.2

<span id="id459" />

#### Prelude

VQE expectation computation with Aer qasm\_simulator now defaults to a computation that has the expected shot noise behavior.

<span id="id460" />

#### Upgrade Notes

*   [cvxpy](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/) is now in the requirements list as a dependency for qiskit-aqua. It is used for the quadratic program solver which is used as part of the `qiskit.aqua.algorithms.QSVM`. Previously `cvxopt` was an optional dependency that needed to be installed to use this functionality. This is no longer required as cvxpy will be installed with qiskit-aqua.
*   For state tomography run as part of `qiskit.aqua.algorithms.HHL` with a QASM backend the tomography fitter function `qiskit.ignis.verification.StateTomographyFitter.fit()` now gets called explicitly with the method set to `lstsq` to always use the least-squares fitting. Previously it would opportunistically try to use the `cvx` fitter if `cvxpy` were installed. But, the `cvx` fitter depends on a specifically configured `cvxpy` installation with an SDP solver installed as part of `cvxpy` which is not always present in an environment with `cvxpy` installed.
*   The VQE expectation computation using qiskit-aer’s `qiskit.providers.aer.extensions.SnapshotExpectationValue` instruction is not enabled by default anymore. This was changed to be the default in 0.7.0 because it is significantly faster, but it led to unexpected ideal results without shot noise (see [#1013](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/issues/1013) for more details). The default has now changed back to match user expectations. Using the faster expectation computation is now opt-in by setting the new `include_custom` kwarg to `True` on the `qiskit.aqua.algorithms.VQE` constructor.

<span id="id462" />

#### New Features

*   A new kwarg `include_custom` has been added to the constructor for `qiskit.aqua.algorithms.VQE` and it’s subclasses (mainly `qiskit.aqua.algorithms.QAOA`). When set to true and the `expectation` kwarg is set to `None` (the default) this will enable the use of VQE expectation computation with Aer’s `qasm_simulator` `qiskit.providers.aer.extensions.SnapshotExpectationValue` instruction. The special Aer snapshot based computation is much faster but with the ideal output similar to state vector simulator.

## 0.19.3

<span id="terra-0-14-1" />

### Terra 0.14.1

No Change

<span id="id464" />

### Aer 0.5.2

<span id="id465" />

#### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed bug with statevector and unitary simulators running a number of (parallel) shots equal to the number of CPU threads instead of only running a single shot.
*   Fixes the “diagonal” qobj gate instructions being applied incorrectly in the density matrix Qasm Simulator method.
*   Fixes bug where conditional gates were not being applied correctly on the density matrix simulation method.
*   Fix bug in CZ gate and Z gate for “density\_matrix\_gpu” and “density\_matrix\_thrust” QasmSimulator methods.
*   Fixes issue where memory requirements of simulation were not being checked on the QasmSimulator when using a non-automatic simulation method.
*   Fixed a memory leak that effected the GPU simulator methods

<span id="id466" />

### Ignis 0.3.0

No Change

<span id="aqua-0-7-1" />

### Aqua 0.7.1

No Change

<span id="id467" />

### IBM Q Provider 0.7.2

<span id="id468" />

#### Bug Fixes

*   `qiskit.provider.ibmq.IBMQBackend.jobs()` will now return the correct list of `IBMQJob` objects when the `status` kwarg is set to `'RUNNING'`. Fixes [#523](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/issues/523)
*   The package metadata has been updated to properly reflect the dependency on `qiskit-terra` >= 0.14.0. This dependency was implicitly added as part of the 0.7.0 release but was not reflected in the package requirements so it was previously possible to install `qiskit-ibmq-provider` with a version of `qiskit-terra` which was too old. Fixes [#677](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/issues/677)

<span id="qiskit-0-19-0" />
## 0.19.0

<span id="terra-0-14-0" />

### Terra 0.14.0

<span id="release-notes-0-14-0-prelude" />

<span id="id471" />

#### Prelude

The 0.14.0 release includes several new features and bug fixes. The biggest change for this release is the introduction of a quantum circuit library in [`qiskit.circuit.library`](/api/qiskit/0.45/circuit_library#module-qiskit.circuit.library "qiskit.circuit.library"), containing some circuit families of interest.

The circuit library gives users access to a rich set of well-studied circuit families, instances of which can be used as benchmarks, as building blocks in building more complex circuits, or as a tool to explore quantum computational advantage over classical. The contents of this library will continue to grow and mature.

The initial release of the circuit library contains:

*   `standard_gates`: these are fixed-width gates commonly used as primitive building blocks, consisting of 1, 2, and 3 qubit gates. For example the [`XGate`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.XGate "qiskit.circuit.library.XGate"), [`RZZGate`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.RZZGate "qiskit.circuit.library.RZZGate") and `CSWAPGate`. The old location of these gates under `qiskit.extensions.standard` is deprecated.
*   `generalized_gates`: these are families that can generalize to arbitrarily many qubits, for example a [`Permutation`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.Permutation "qiskit.circuit.library.Permutation") or [`GMS`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.GMS "qiskit.circuit.library.GMS") (Global Molmer-Sorensen gate).
*   `boolean_logic`: circuits that transform basis states according to simple Boolean logic functions, such as `ADD` or [`XOR`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.XOR "qiskit.circuit.library.XOR").
*   `arithmetic`: a set of circuits for doing classical arithmetic such as [`WeightedAdder`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.WeightedAdder "qiskit.circuit.library.WeightedAdder") and [`IntegerComparator`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.IntegerComparator "qiskit.circuit.library.IntegerComparator").
*   `basis_changes`: circuits such as the quantum Fourier transform, [`QFT`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.QFT "qiskit.circuit.library.QFT"), that mathematically apply basis changes.
*   `n_local`: patterns to easily create large circuits with rotation and entanglement layers, such as [`TwoLocal`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.TwoLocal "qiskit.circuit.library.TwoLocal") which uses single-qubit rotations and two-qubit entanglements.
*   `data_preparation`: circuits that take classical input data and encode it in a quantum state that is difficult to simulate, e.g. [`PauliFeatureMap`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.PauliFeatureMap "qiskit.circuit.library.PauliFeatureMap") or [`ZZFeatureMap`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.ZZFeatureMap "qiskit.circuit.library.ZZFeatureMap").
*   Other circuits that have proven interesting in the literature, such as [`QuantumVolume`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.QuantumVolume "qiskit.circuit.library.QuantumVolume"), [`GraphState`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.GraphState "qiskit.circuit.library.GraphState"), or [`IQP`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.IQP "qiskit.circuit.library.IQP").

To allow easier use of these circuits as building blocks, we have introduced a [`compose()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#compose "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.compose") method of [`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") for composition of circuits either with other circuits (by welding them at the ends and optionally permuting wires) or with other simpler gates:

```python
>>> lhs.compose(rhs, qubits=[3, 2], inplace=True)
```

```python
            ┌───┐                   ┌─────┐                ┌───┐

         └─────────┘                                    └─────────┘└─┬─┘┌─────┐

            ┌─┴─┐                                          ┌─┴─┐        └─────┘
lqr_2_1: ───┤ X ├───                           lqr_2_1: ───┤ X ├───────────────
            └───┘                                          └───┘
lcr_0: 0 ═══════════                           lcr_0: 0 ═══════════════════════
lcr_1: 0 ═══════════                           lcr_1: 0 ═══════════════════════
```

With this, Qiskit’s circuits no longer assume an implicit initial state of $|0\rangle$, and will not be drawn with this initial state. The all-zero initial state is still assumed on a backend when a circuit is executed.

<span id="release-notes-0-14-0-new-features" />

<span id="id472" />

#### New Features

*   A new method, [`has_entry()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.EquivalenceLibrary#has_entry "qiskit.circuit.EquivalenceLibrary.has_entry"), has been added to the [`qiskit.circuit.EquivalenceLibrary`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.EquivalenceLibrary "qiskit.circuit.EquivalenceLibrary") class to quickly check if a given gate has any known decompositions in the library.

*   A new class [`IQP`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.IQP "qiskit.circuit.library.IQP"), to construct an instantaneous quantum polynomial circuit, has been added to the circuit library module [`qiskit.circuit.library`](/api/qiskit/0.45/circuit_library#module-qiskit.circuit.library "qiskit.circuit.library").

*   A new [`compose()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#compose "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.compose") method has been added to [`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit"). It allows composition of two quantum circuits without having to turn one into a gate or instruction. It also allows permutations of qubits/clbits at the point of composition, as well as optional inplace modification. It can also be used in place of [`append()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#append "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.append"), as it allows composing instructions and operators onto the circuit as well.

*   [`qiskit.circuit.library.Diagonal`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.Diagonal "qiskit.circuit.library.Diagonal") circuits have been added to the circuit library. These circuits implement diagonal quantum operators (consisting of non-zero elements only on the diagonal). They are more efficiently simulated by the Aer simulator than dense matrices.

*   Add [`from_label()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford#from_label "qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford.from_label") method to the [`qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford "qiskit.quantum_info.Clifford") class for initializing as the tensor product of single-qubit I, X, Y, Z, H, or S gates.

*   Schedule transformer `qiskit.pulse.reschedule.compress_pulses()` performs an optimization pass to reduce the usage of waveform memory in hardware by replacing multiple identical instances of a pulse in a pulse schedule with a single pulse. For example:

    ```python
    from qiskit.pulse import reschedule

    schedules = []
    for _ in range(2):
        schedule = Schedule()
        drive_channel = DriveChannel(0)
        schedule += Play(SamplePulse([0.0, 0.1]), drive_channel)
        schedule += Play(SamplePulse([0.0, 0.1]), drive_channel)
        schedules.append(schedule)

    compressed_schedules = reschedule.compress_pulses(schedules)
    ```

*   The [`qiskit.transpiler.Layout`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.transpiler.Layout "qiskit.transpiler.Layout") has a new method [`reorder_bits()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.transpiler.Layout#reorder_bits "qiskit.transpiler.Layout.reorder_bits") that is used to reorder a list of virtual qubits based on the layout object.

*   Two new methods have been added to the [`qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration "qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration") for interacting with channels.

    *   [`get_channel_qubits()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration#get_channel_qubits "qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.get_channel_qubits") to get a list of all qubits operated by the given channel and
    *   `get_qubit_channel()` to get a list of channels operating on the given qubit.

*   New `qiskit.extensions.HamiltonianGate` and [`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.hamiltonian()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#hamiltonian "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.hamiltonian") methods are introduced, representing Hamiltonian evolution of the circuit wavefunction by a user-specified Hermitian Operator and evolution time. The evolution time can be a [`Parameter`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter"), allowing the creation of parameterized UCCSD or QAOA-style circuits which compile to `UnitaryGate` objects if `time` parameters are provided. The Unitary of a `HamiltonianGate` with Hamiltonian Operator `H` and time parameter `t` is $e^{-iHt}$.

*   The circuit library module [`qiskit.circuit.library`](/api/qiskit/0.45/circuit_library#module-qiskit.circuit.library "qiskit.circuit.library") now provides a new boolean logic AND circuit, [`qiskit.circuit.library.AND`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.AND "qiskit.circuit.library.AND"), and OR circuit, [`qiskit.circuit.library.OR`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.OR "qiskit.circuit.library.OR"), which implement the respective operations on a variable number of provided qubits.

*   New fake backends are added under `qiskit.test.mock`. These include mocked versions of `ibmq_armonk`, `ibmq_essex`, `ibmq_london`, `ibmq_valencia`, `ibmq_cambridge`, `ibmq_paris`, `ibmq_rome`, and `ibmq_athens`. As with other fake backends, these include snapshots of calibration data (i.e. `backend.defaults()`) and error data (i.e. `backend.properties()`) taken from the real system, and can be used for local testing, compilation and simulation.

*   The `last_update_date` parameter for [`BackendProperties`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties "qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties") can now also be passed in as a `datetime` object. Previously only a string in ISO8601 format was accepted.

*   Adds [`qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector.from_int()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector#from_int "qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector.from_int") and [`qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix.from_int()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix#from_int "qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix.from_int") methods that allow constructing a computational basis state for specified system dimensions.

*   The methods on the [`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") class for adding gates (for example [`h()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#h "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.h")) which were previously added dynamically at run time to the class definition have been refactored to be statically defined methods of the class. This means that static analyzer (such as IDEs) can now read these methods.

<span id="release-notes-0-14-0-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id473" />

#### Upgrade Notes

*   A new package, [python-dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/), is now required and has been added to the requirements list. It is being used to parse datetime strings received from external providers in [`BackendProperties`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties "qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties") objects.

*   The marshmallow schema classes in [`qiskit.providers.models`](/api/qiskit/0.45/providers_models#module-qiskit.providers.models "qiskit.providers.models") have been removed since they are no longer used by the BackendObjects.

*   The output of the `to_dict()` method for the classes in [`qiskit.providers.models`](/api/qiskit/0.45/providers_models#module-qiskit.providers.models "qiskit.providers.models") is no longer in a format for direct JSON serialization. Depending on the content contained in instances of these class there may be numpy arrays and/or complex numbers in the fields of the dict. If you’re JSON serializing the output of the to\_dict methods you should ensure your JSON encoder can handle numpy arrays and complex numbers. This includes:

    *   [`qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration.to_dict()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration#to_dict "qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration.to_dict")
    *   [`qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties.to_dict()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties#to_dict "qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties.to_dict")
    *   [`qiskit.providers.models.BackendStatus.to_dict()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.BackendStatus#to_dict "qiskit.providers.models.BackendStatus.to_dict")
    *   [`qiskit.providers.models.QasmBackendConfiguration.to_dict()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.QasmBackendConfiguration#to_dict "qiskit.providers.models.QasmBackendConfiguration.to_dict")
    *   [`qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.to_dict()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration#to_dict "qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.to_dict")
    *   [`qiskit.providers.models.UchannelLO.to_dict()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.UchannelLO#to_dict "qiskit.providers.models.UchannelLO.to_dict")
    *   [`qiskit.providers.models.GateConfig.to_dict()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.GateConfig#to_dict "qiskit.providers.models.GateConfig.to_dict")

#### Deprecation Notes

*   The [`qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.compose()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit#compose "qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit.compose") method now takes a list of qubits/clbits that specify the positional order of bits to compose onto. The dictionary-based method of mapping using the `edge_map` argument is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

*   The `combine_into_edge_map()` method for the [`qiskit.transpiler.Layout`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.transpiler.Layout "qiskit.transpiler.Layout") class has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead, the new method [`reorder_bits()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.transpiler.Layout#reorder_bits "qiskit.transpiler.Layout.reorder_bits") should be used to reorder a list of virtual qubits according to the layout object.

*   Passing a `qiskit.pulse.ControlChannel` object in via the parameter `channel` for the [`qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration "qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration") method [`control()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration#control "qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.control") has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The `ControlChannel` objects are now generated from the backend configuration `channels` attribute which has the information of all channels and the qubits they operate on. Now, the method [`control()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration#control "qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration.control") is expected to take the parameter `qubits` of the form `(control_qubit, target_qubit)` and type `list` or `tuple`, and returns a list of control channels.

*   The `AND` and `OR` methods of [`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead you should use the circuit library boolean logic classes [`qiskit.circuit.library.AND`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.AND "qiskit.circuit.library.AND") amd [`qiskit.circuit.library.OR`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.library.OR "qiskit.circuit.library.OR") and then append those objects to your class. For example:

    ```python
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
    from qiskit.circuit.library import AND

    qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)

    qc_and = AND(2)

    qc.compose(qc_and, inplace=True)
    ```

*   The `qiskit.extensions.standard` module is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The gate classes in that module have been moved to `qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates`.

#### Bug Fixes

*   The [`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") methods [`inverse()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#inverse "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit.inverse"), `mirror()` methods, as well as the `QuantumCircuit.data` setter would generate an invalid circuit when used on a parameterized circuit instance. This has been resolved and these methods should now work with a parameterized circuit. Fixes [#4235](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4235)

*   Previously when creating a controlled version of a standard qiskit gate if a `ctrl_state` was specified a generic `ControlledGate` object would be returned whereas without it a standard qiskit controlled gate would be returned if it was defined. This PR allows standard qiskit controlled gates to understand `ctrl_state`.

    Additionally, this PR fixes what might be considered a bug where setting the `ctrl_state` of an already controlled gate would assume the specified state applied to the full control width instead of the control qubits being added. For instance,:

    ```python
    circ = QuantumCircuit(2)
    circ.h(0)
    circ.x(1)
    gate = circ.to_gate()
    cgate = gate.control(1)
    c3gate = cgate.control(2, ctrl_state=0)
    ```

    would apply `ctrl_state` to all three control qubits instead of just the two control qubits being added.

*   Fixed a bug in [`random_clifford()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/quantum_info#qiskit.quantum_info.random_clifford "qiskit.quantum_info.random_clifford") that stopped it from sampling the full Clifford group. Fixes [#4271](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4271)

*   The [`qiskit.circuit.Instruction`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.Instruction "qiskit.circuit.Instruction") method [`qiskit.circuit.Instruction.is_parameterized()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.Instruction#is_parameterized "qiskit.circuit.Instruction.is_parameterized") method had previously returned `True` for any `Instruction` instance which had a [`qiskit.circuit.Parameter`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") in any element of its `params` array, even if that `Parameter` had been fully bound. This has been corrected so that `.is_parameterized` will return `False` when the instruction is fully bound.

*   [`qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression.subs()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression#subs "qiskit.circuit.ParameterExpression.subs") had not correctly detected some cases where substituting parameters would result in a two distinct `Parameters` objects in an expression with the same name. This has been corrected so a `CircuitError` will be raised in these cases.

*   Improve performance of [`qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector "qiskit.quantum_info.Statevector") and [`qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix "qiskit.quantum_info.DensityMatrix") for low-qubit circuit simulations by optimizing the class `__init__` methods. Fixes [#4281](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/4281)

*   The function [`qiskit.compiler.transpile()`](/api/qiskit/0.45/compiler#qiskit.compiler.transpile "qiskit.compiler.transpile") now correctly handles when the parameter `basis_gates` is set to `None`. This will allow any gate in the output tranpiled circuit, including gates added by the transpilation process. Note that using this parameter may have some unintended consequences during optimization. Some transpiler passes depend on having a `basis_gates` set. For example, [`qiskit.transpiler.passes.Optimize1qGates`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.transpiler.passes.Optimize1qGates "qiskit.transpiler.passes.Optimize1qGates") only optimizes the chains of u1, u2, and u3 gates and without `basis_gates` it is unable to unroll gates that otherwise could be optimized:

    ```python
    from qiskit import *

    q = QuantumRegister(1, name='q')
    circuit = QuantumCircuit(q)
    circuit.h(q[0])
    circuit.u1(0.1, q[0])
    circuit.u2(0.1, 0.2, q[0])
    circuit.h(q[0])
    circuit.u3(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, q[0])

    result = transpile(circuit, basis_gates=None, optimization_level=3)
    result.draw()
    ```

    ```python
         ┌───┐┌─────────────┐┌───┐┌─────────────────┐
    q_0: ┤ H ├┤ U2(0.1,0.3) ├┤ H ├┤ U3(0.1,0.2,0.3) ├
         └───┘└─────────────┘└───┘└─────────────────┘
    ```

    Fixes [#3017](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/3017)

#### Other Notes

*   The objects in [`qiskit.providers.models`](/api/qiskit/0.45/providers_models#module-qiskit.providers.models "qiskit.providers.models") which were previously constructed using the marshmallow library have been refactored to not depend on marshmallow. This includes:

    *   [`BackendConfiguration`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration "qiskit.providers.models.BackendConfiguration")
    *   [`BackendProperties`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties "qiskit.providers.models.BackendProperties")
    *   [`BackendStatus`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.BackendStatus "qiskit.providers.models.BackendStatus")
    *   [`QasmBackendConfiguration`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.QasmBackendConfiguration "qiskit.providers.models.QasmBackendConfiguration")
    *   [`PulseBackendConfiguration`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration "qiskit.providers.models.PulseBackendConfiguration")
    *   [`UchannelLO`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.UchannelLO "qiskit.providers.models.UchannelLO")
    *   [`GateConfig`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.GateConfig "qiskit.providers.models.GateConfig")
    *   [`PulseDefaults`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.PulseDefaults "qiskit.providers.models.PulseDefaults")
    *   [`Command`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.Command "qiskit.providers.models.Command")
    *   [`JobStatus`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.JobStatus "qiskit.providers.models.JobStatus")
    *   [`Nduv`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.providers.models.Nduv "qiskit.providers.models.Nduv")
    *   `Gate`

    These should be drop-in replacements without any noticeable change but specifics inherited from marshmallow may not work. Please file issues for any incompatibilities found.

### Aer 0.5.1

No Change

<span id="id481" />

### Ignis 0.3.0

No Change

<span id="aqua-0-7-0" />

### Aqua 0.7.0

<span id="id482" />

#### Prelude

The Qiskit Aqua 0.7.0 release introduces a lot of new functionality along with an improved integration with [`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit`](/api/qiskit/0.45/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit") objects. The central contributions are the Qiskit’s optimization module, a complete refactor on Operators, using circuits as native input for the algorithms and removal of the declarative JSON API.

##### Optimization module

The `` qiskit.optimization` `` module now offers functionality for modeling and solving quadratic programs. It provides various near-term quantum and conventional algorithms, such as the `MinimumEigenOptimizer` (covering e.g. `VQE` or `QAOA`) or `CplexOptimizer`, as well as a set of converters to translate between different problem representations, such as `QuadraticProgramToQubo`. See the [changelog](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/#migration-guide) for a list of the added features.

##### Operator flow

The operator logic provided in `` qiskit.aqua.operators` `` was completely refactored and is now a full set of tools for constructing physically-intuitive quantum computations. It contains state functions, operators and measurements and internally relies on Terra’s Operator objects. Computing expectation values and evolutions was heavily simplified and objects like the `ExpectationFactory` produce the suitable, most efficient expectation algorithm based on the Operator input type. See the [changelog](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/#migration-guide) for a overview of the added functionality.

##### Native circuits

Algorithms commonly use parameterized circuits as input, for example the VQE, VQC or QSVM. Previously, these inputs had to be of type `VariationalForm` or `FeatureMap` which were wrapping the circuit object. Now circuits are natively supported in these algorithms, which means any individually constructed `QuantumCircuit` can be passed to these algorithms. In combination with the release of the circuit library which offers a wide collection of circuit families, it is now easy to construct elaborate circuits as algorithm input.

##### Declarative JSON API

The ability of running algorithms using dictionaries as parameters as well as using the Aqua interfaces GUI has been removed.

### IBM Q Provider 0.7.0

<span id="release-notes-0-7-0-new-features" />

<span id="id484" />

#### New Features

*   A new exception, `qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackendJobLimitError`, is now raised if a job could not be submitted because the limit on active jobs has been reached.
*   `qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob` and `qiskit.providers.ibmq.managed.ManagedJobSet` each has two new methods `update_name` and `update_tags`. They are used to change the name and tags of a job or a job set, respectively.
*   `qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQFactory.save_account()` and `qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQFactory.enable_account()` now accept optional parameters `hub`, `group`, and `project`, which allow specifying a default provider to save to disk or use, respectively.

<span id="release-notes-0-7-0-upgrade-notes" />

<span id="id485" />

#### Upgrade Notes

*   The `qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob` methods `creation_date` and `time_per_step` now return date time information as a `datetime` object in local time instead of UTC. Similarly, the parameters `start_datetime` and `end_datetime`, of `qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackendService.jobs()` and `qiskit.providers.ibmq.IBMQBackend.jobs()` can now be specified in local time.
*   The `qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.QueueInfo.format()` method now uses a custom `datetime` to string formatter, and the package [arrow](https://pypi.org/project/arrow/) is no longer required and has been removed from the requirements list.
