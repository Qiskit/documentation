# Qubit

<Class id="qiskit.circuit.Qubit" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.24/qiskit/circuit/quantumregister.py" signature="Qubit(register=None, index=None)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: [`Bit`](qiskit.circuit.Bit "qiskit.circuit.bit.Bit")

  Implement a quantum bit.

  Creates a qubit.

  **Parameters**

  *   **register** ([*QuantumRegister*](qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister "qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister")) – Optional. A quantum register containing the bit.
  *   **index** (*int*) – Optional. The index of the bit in its containing register.

  **Raises**

  **CircuitError** – if the provided register is not a valid [`QuantumRegister`](qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister "qiskit.circuit.QuantumRegister")

  ## Attributes

  ### index

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.Qubit.index">
    Get the index of an old-style bit in the register that owns it.

    In modern Qiskit Terra (version 0.17+), bits are the fundamental object and registers are aliases to collections of bits. A bit can be in many registers depending on the circuit, so a single containing register is no longer a property of a bit. It is an error to access this attribute on bits that were not constructed as “owned” by a register.

    <Admonition title="Deprecated since version 0.17" type="danger">
      The property `qiskit.circuit.bit.Bit.index` is deprecated as of qiskit-terra 0.17. It will be removed no earlier than 3 months after the release date. Instead, use `find_bit()` to find all the containing registers within a circuit and the index of the bit within the circuit.
