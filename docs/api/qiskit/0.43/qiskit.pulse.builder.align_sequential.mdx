# qiskit.pulse.builder.align\_sequential

<Function id="qiskit.pulse.builder.align_sequential" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.24/qiskit/pulse/builder.py" signature="align_sequential()">
  Sequential alignment pulse scheduling context.

  Pulse instructions within this context are scheduled sequentially in time such that no two instructions will be played at the same time.

  Examples:

  ```python
  from qiskit import pulse

  d0 = pulse.DriveChannel(0)
  d1 = pulse.DriveChannel(1)

  with pulse.build() as pulse_prog:
      with pulse.align_sequential():
          # this pulse will start at t=0
          pulse.play(pulse.Constant(100, 1.0), d0)
          # this pulse will also start at t=100
          pulse.play(pulse.Constant(20, 1.0), d1)
  pulse_prog = pulse.transforms.block_to_schedule(pulse_prog)

  assert pulse_prog.ch_stop_time(d0) == pulse_prog.ch_start_time(d1)
  ```

  **Yields**

  None

  **Return type**

  [*AlignmentKind*](pulse#qiskit.pulse.transforms.AlignmentKind "qiskit.pulse.transforms.alignments.AlignmentKind")
