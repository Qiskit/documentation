# ScheduleBlock

<Class id="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.45/qiskit/pulse/schedule.py" signature="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock(name=None, metadata=None, alignment_context=None)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: [`object`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#object "(in Python v3.12)")

  Time-ordered sequence of instructions with alignment context.

  [`ScheduleBlock`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock") supports lazy scheduling of context instructions, i.e. their timeslots is always generated at runtime. This indicates we can parametrize instruction durations as well as other parameters. In contrast to [`Schedule`](qiskit.pulse.Schedule "qiskit.pulse.Schedule") being somewhat static, [`ScheduleBlock`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock") is a dynamic representation of a pulse program.

  **Pulse Builder**

  The Qiskit pulse builder is a domain specific language that is developed on top of the schedule block. Use of the builder syntax will improve the workflow of pulse programming. See [Pulse Builder](pulse#pulse-builder) for a user guide.

  **Alignment contexts**

  A schedule block is always relatively scheduled. Instead of taking individual instructions with absolute execution time `t0`, the schedule block defines a context of scheduling and instructions under the same context are scheduled in the same manner (alignment). Several contexts are available in [Alignments](pulse#pulse-alignments). A schedule block is instantiated with one of these alignment contexts. The default context is `AlignLeft`, for which all instructions are left-justified, in other words, meaning they use as-soon-as-possible scheduling.

  If you need an absolute-time interval in between instructions, you can explicitly insert [`Delay`](qiskit.pulse.instructions.Delay "qiskit.pulse.instructions.Delay") instructions.

  **Nested blocks**

  A schedule block can contain other nested blocks with different alignment contexts. This enables advanced scheduling, where a subset of instructions is locally scheduled in a different manner. Note that a [`Schedule`](qiskit.pulse.Schedule "qiskit.pulse.Schedule") instance cannot be directly added to a schedule block. To add a [`Schedule`](qiskit.pulse.Schedule "qiskit.pulse.Schedule") instance, wrap it in a [`Call`](qiskit.pulse.instructions.Call "qiskit.pulse.instructions.Call") instruction. This is implicitly performed when a schedule is added through the [Pulse Builder](pulse#pulse-builder).

  **Unsupported operations**

  Because the schedule block representation lacks timeslots, it cannot perform particular [`Schedule`](qiskit.pulse.Schedule "qiskit.pulse.Schedule") operations such as `insert()` or `shift()` that require instruction start time `t0`. In addition, [`exclude()`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.exclude "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.exclude") and [`filter()`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.filter "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.filter") methods are not supported because these operations may identify the target instruction with `t0`. Except for these operations, [`ScheduleBlock`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock") provides full compatibility with [`Schedule`](qiskit.pulse.Schedule "qiskit.pulse.Schedule").

  **Subroutine**

  The timeslots-free representation offers much greater flexibility for writing pulse programs. Because [`ScheduleBlock`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock") only cares about the ordering of the child blocks we can add an undefined pulse sequence as a subroutine of the main program. If your program contains the same sequence multiple times, this representation may reduce the memory footprint required by the program construction. Such a subroutine is realized by the special compiler directive [`Reference`](qiskit.pulse.instructions.Reference "qiskit.pulse.instructions.Reference") that is defined by a unique set of reference key strings to the subroutine. The (executable) subroutine is separately stored in the main program. Appended reference directives are resolved when the main program is executed. Subroutines must be assigned through [`assign_references()`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.assign_references "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.assign_references") before execution.

  **Program Scoping**

  When you call a subroutine from another subroutine, or append a schedule block to another schedule block, the management of references and parameters can be a hard task. Schedule block offers a convenient feature to help with this by automatically scoping the parameters and subroutines.

  ```python
  from qiskit import pulse
  from qiskit.circuit.parameter import Parameter

  amp1 = Parameter("amp")

  with pulse.build() as sched1:
      pulse.play(pulse.Constant(100, amp1), pulse.DriveChannel(0))

  print(sched1.scoped_parameters())
  ```

  ```python
  (Parameter(root::amp),)
  ```

  The [`scoped_parameters()`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.scoped_parameters "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.scoped_parameters") method returns all [`Parameter`](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.Parameter") objects defined in the schedule block. The parameter name is updated to reflect its scope information, i.e. where it is defined. The outer scope is called “root”. Since the “amp” parameter is directly used in the current builder context, it is prefixed with “root”. Note that the `Parameter` object returned by [`scoped_parameters()`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.scoped_parameters "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.scoped_parameters") preserves the hidden [UUID](https://docs.python.org/3/library/uuid.html#module-uuid) key, and thus the scoped name doesn’t break references to the original `Parameter`.

  You may want to call this program from another program. In this example, the program is called with the reference key “grand\_child”. You can call a subroutine without specifying a substantial program (like `sched1` above which we will assign later).

  ```python
  amp2 = Parameter("amp")

  with pulse.build() as sched2:
      with pulse.align_right():
          pulse.reference("grand_child")
          pulse.play(pulse.Constant(200, amp2), pulse.DriveChannel(0))

  print(sched2.scoped_parameters())
  ```

  ```python
  (Parameter(root::amp),)
  ```

  This only returns “root::amp” because the “grand\_child” reference is unknown. Now you assign the actual pulse program to this reference.

  ```python
  sched2.assign_references({("grand_child", ): sched1})
  print(sched2.scoped_parameters())
  ```

  ```python
  (Parameter(root::amp), Parameter(root::grand_child::amp))
  ```

  Now you get two parameters “root::amp” and “root::grand\_child::amp”. The second parameter name indicates it is defined within the referred program “grand\_child”. The program calling the “grand\_child” has a reference program description which is accessed through [`ScheduleBlock.references`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.references "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.references").

  ```python
  print(sched2.references)
  ```

  ```python
  ReferenceManager:
    - ('grand_child',): ScheduleBlock(Play(Constant(duration=100, amp=amp,...
  ```

  Finally, you may want to call this program from another program. Here we try a different approach to define subroutine. Namely, we call a subroutine from the root program with the actual program `sched2`.

  ```python
  amp3 = Parameter("amp")

  with pulse.build() as main:
      pulse.play(pulse.Constant(300, amp3), pulse.DriveChannel(0))
      pulse.call(sched2, name="child")

  print(main.scoped_parameters())
  ```

  ```python
  (Parameter(root::amp), Parameter(root::child::amp), Parameter(root::child::grand_child::amp))
  ```

  This implicitly creates a reference named “child” within the root program and assigns `sched2` to it. You get three parameters “root::amp”, “root::child::amp”, and “root::child::grand\_child::amp”. As you can see, each parameter name reflects the layer of calls from the root program. If you know the scope of a parameter, you can directly get the parameter object using [`ScheduleBlock.search_parameters()`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.search_parameters "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.search_parameters") as follows.

  ```python
  main.search_parameters("root::child::grand_child::amp")
  ```

  You can use a regular expression to specify the scope. The following returns the parameters defined within the scope of “ground\_child” regardless of its parent scope. This is sometimes convenient if you want to extract parameters from a deeply nested program.

  ```python
  main.search_parameters("\S::grand_child::amp")
  ```

  Note that the root program is only aware of its direct references.

  ```python
  print(main.references)
  ```

  ```python
  ReferenceManager:
    - ('child',): ScheduleBlock(ScheduleBlock(ScheduleBlock(Play(Con...
  ```

  As you can see the main program cannot directly assign a subroutine to the “grand\_child” because this subroutine is not called within the root program, i.e. it is indirectly called by “child”. However, the returned `ReferenceManager` is a dict-like object, and you can still reach to “grand\_child” via the “child” program with the following chained dict access.

  ```python
  main.references[("child", )].references[("grand_child", )]
  ```

  Note that [`ScheduleBlock.parameters`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.parameters "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.parameters") and [`ScheduleBlock.scoped_parameters()`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.scoped_parameters "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.scoped_parameters") still collect all parameters also from the subroutine once it’s assigned.

  Create an empty schedule block.

  **Parameters**

  *   **name** ([*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.12)") *| None*) – Name of this schedule. Defaults to an autogenerated string if not provided.
  *   **metadata** ([*dict*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict "(in Python v3.12)") *| None*) – Arbitrary key value metadata to associate with the schedule. This gets stored as free-form data in a dict in the [`metadata`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.metadata "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.metadata") attribute. It will not be directly used in the schedule.
  *   **alignment\_context** ([*AlignmentKind*](pulse#qiskit.pulse.transforms.AlignmentKind "qiskit.pulse.transforms.AlignmentKind")) – `AlignmentKind` instance that manages scheduling of instructions in this block.

  **Raises**

  [**TypeError**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError "(in Python v3.12)") – if metadata is not a dict.

    **Raises**

    [**PulseError**](pulse#qiskit.pulse.PulseError "qiskit.pulse.PulseError") – When invalid schedule type is specified.

    **Return type**

    [*ScheduleBlock*](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock")
  </Function>

    [**PulseError**](pulse#qiskit.pulse.PulseError "qiskit.pulse.PulseError") – When the block is nested into another block.

    **Return type**

    [*ScheduleBlock*](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock")
  </Function>

  ### assign\_references

  <Function id="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.assign_references" signature="assign_references(subroutine_dict, inplace=True)">
    Assign schedules to references.

    It is only capable of assigning a schedule block to immediate references which are directly referred within the current scope. Let’s see following example:

    ```python
    from qiskit import pulse

    with pulse.build() as subroutine:
        pulse.delay(10, pulse.DriveChannel(0))

    with pulse.build() as sub_prog:
        pulse.reference("A")

    with pulse.build() as main_prog:
        pulse.reference("B")
    ```

    In above example, the `main_prog` can refer to the subroutine “root::B” and the reference of “B” to program “A”, i.e., “B::A”, is not defined in the root namespace. This prevents breaking the reference “root::B::A” by the assignment of “root::B”. For example, if a user could indirectly assign “root::B::A” from the root program, one can later assign another program to “root::B” that doesn’t contain “A” within it. In this situation, a reference “root::B::A” would still live in the reference manager of the root. However, the subroutine “root::B::A” would no longer be used in the actual pulse program. To assign subroutine “A” to `nested_prog` as a nested subprogram of `main_prog`, you must first assign “A” of the `sub_prog`, and then assign the `sub_prog` to the `main_prog`.

    ```python
    sub_prog.assign_references({("A", ): nested_prog}, inplace=True)
    main_prog.assign_references({("B", ): sub_prog}, inplace=True)
    ```

    Alternatively, you can also write

    ```python
    main_prog.assign_references({("B", ): sub_prog}, inplace=True)
    main_prog.references[("B", )].assign_references({"A": nested_prog}, inplace=True)
    ```

    Here [`references`](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.references "qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.references") returns a dict-like object, and you can mutably update the nested reference of the particular subroutine.

    <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
      Assigned programs are deep-copied to prevent an unexpected update.
    </Admonition>

    **Parameters**

    *   **subroutine\_dict** ([*Dict*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Dict "(in Python v3.12)")*\[*[*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.12)")  *|*[*Tuple*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Tuple "(in Python v3.12)")*\[*[*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.12)")*, ...],* [*ScheduleBlock*](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock")*]*) – A mapping from reference key to schedule block of the subroutine.
    *   **inplace** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.12)")) – Set `True` to override this instance with new subroutine.

    **Returns**

    Schedule block with assigned subroutine.

    **Raises**

    [**PulseError**](pulse#qiskit.pulse.PulseError "qiskit.pulse.PulseError") – When reference key is not defined in the current scope.

  </Function>

  ### draw

  ### get\_parameters

  <Function id="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.get_parameters" signature="get_parameters(parameter_name)">
    Get parameter object bound to this schedule by string name.

    Note that we can define different parameter objects with the same name, because these different objects are identified by their unique uuid. For example,

    ```python
    from qiskit import pulse, circuit

    amp1 = circuit.Parameter("amp")
    amp2 = circuit.Parameter("amp")

    with pulse.build() as sub_prog:
        pulse.play(pulse.Constant(100, amp1), pulse.DriveChannel(0))

    with pulse.build() as main_prog:
        pulse.call(sub_prog, name="sub")
        pulse.play(pulse.Constant(100, amp2), pulse.DriveChannel(0))

    main_prog.get_parameters("amp")
    ```

    This returns a list of two parameters `amp1` and `amp2`.

  ### is\_parameterized

  <Function id="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.is_parameterized" signature="is_parameterized()">
    Return True iff the instruction is parameterized.

    **Return type**

    [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.12)")
  </Function>

  ### is\_referenced

  <Function id="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.is_referenced" signature="is_referenced()">
    Return True iff the current schedule block contains reference to subroutine.

    **Return type**

    [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.12)")
  </Function>

  ### is\_schedulable

  <Function id="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.is_schedulable" signature="is_schedulable()">
    Return `True` if all durations are assigned.

    **Return type**

    [bool](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.12)")
  </Function>

  ### replace

  <Function id="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.replace" signature="replace(old, new, inplace=True)">
    Return a `ScheduleBlock` with the `old` component replaced with a `new` component.

    **Parameters**

    *   **old** ([*ScheduleBlock*](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock")  *|*[*Instruction*](pulse#qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction "qiskit.pulse.instructions.instruction.Instruction")) – Schedule block component to replace.
    *   **new** ([*ScheduleBlock*](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock")  *|*[*Instruction*](pulse#qiskit.pulse.instructions.Instruction "qiskit.pulse.instructions.instruction.Instruction")) – Schedule block component to replace with.
    *   **inplace** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.12)")) – Replace instruction by mutably modifying this `ScheduleBlock`.

    **Returns**

    The modified schedule block with `old` replaced by `new`.

    **Return type**

    [*ScheduleBlock*](#qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock "qiskit.pulse.schedule.ScheduleBlock")
  </Function>

  ### scoped\_parameters

  <Function id="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.scoped_parameters" signature="scoped_parameters()">
    Return unassigned parameters with scoped names.

    <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
      If a parameter is defined within a nested scope, it is prefixed with all parent-scope names with the delimiter string, which is “::”. If a reference key of the scope consists of multiple key strings, it will be represented by a single string joined with “,”. For example, “root::xgate,q0::amp” for the parameter “amp” defined in the reference specified by the key strings (“xgate”, “q0”).
    </Admonition>

    **Return type**

    [*Tuple*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Tuple "(in Python v3.12)")\[[*Parameter*](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.parameter.Parameter")]
  </Function>

  ### search\_parameters

  <Function id="qiskit.pulse.ScheduleBlock.search_parameters" signature="search_parameters(parameter_regex)">
    Search parameter with regular expression.

    This method looks for the scope-aware parameters. For example,

    ```python
    from qiskit import pulse, circuit

    amp1 = circuit.Parameter("amp")
    amp2 = circuit.Parameter("amp")

    with pulse.build() as sub_prog:
        pulse.play(pulse.Constant(100, amp1), pulse.DriveChannel(0))

    with pulse.build() as main_prog:
        pulse.call(sub_prog, name="sub")
        pulse.play(pulse.Constant(100, amp2), pulse.DriveChannel(0))

    main_prog.search_parameters("root::sub::amp")
    ```

    This finds `amp1` with scoped name “root::sub::amp”.

    **Parameters**

    **parameter\_regex** ([*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.12)")) – Regular expression for scoped parameter name.

    **Returns**

    Parameter objects that have corresponding name.

    **Return type**

    [*List*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.List "(in Python v3.12)")\[[*Parameter*](qiskit.circuit.Parameter "qiskit.circuit.parameter.Parameter")]
