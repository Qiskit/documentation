`ListOp.to_matrix(massive=False)`

Return NumPy representation of the Operator. Represents the evaluation of the Operator’s underlying function on every combination of basis binary strings. Warn if more than 16 qubits to force having to set `massive=True` if such a large vector is desired.

**Return type**

`ndarray`

**Returns**
