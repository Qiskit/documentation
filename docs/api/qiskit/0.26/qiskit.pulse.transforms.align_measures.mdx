# qiskit.pulse.transforms.align\_measures

<Function id="qiskit.pulse.transforms.align_measures" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.17/qiskit/pulse/transforms/canonicalization.py" signature="align_measures(schedules, inst_map=None, cal_gate='u3', max_calibration_duration=None, align_time=None, align_all=True)">
  Return new schedules where measurements occur at the same physical time.

  This transformation will align the first [`qiskit.pulse.Acquire`](qiskit.pulse.Acquire "qiskit.pulse.Acquire") on every channel to occur at the same time.

  Minimum measurement wait time (to allow for calibration pulses) is enforced and may be set with `max_calibration_duration`.

  By default only instructions containing a [`AcquireChannel`](qiskit.pulse.AcquireChannel "qiskit.pulse.AcquireChannel") or [`MeasureChannel`](qiskit.pulse.MeasureChannel "qiskit.pulse.MeasureChannel") will be shifted. If you wish to keep the relative timing of all instructions in the schedule set `align_all=True`.

  This method assumes that `MeasureChannel(i)` and `AcquireChannel(i)` correspond to the same qubit and the acquire/play instructions should be shifted together on these channels.

  ```python
  from qiskit import pulse
  from qiskit.pulse import transforms

  with pulse.build() as sched:
      with pulse.align_sequential():
          pulse.play(pulse.Constant(10, 0.5), pulse.DriveChannel(0))
          pulse.play(pulse.Constant(10, 1.), pulse.MeasureChannel(0))
          pulse.acquire(20, pulse.AcquireChannel(0), pulse.MemorySlot(0))

  sched_shifted = sched << 20

  aligned_sched, aligned_sched_shifted = transforms.align_measures([sched, sched_shifted])

  assert aligned_sched == aligned_sched_shifted
  ```

  If it is desired to only shift acquisition and measurement stimulus instructions set the flag `align_all=False`:

  ```python
  aligned_sched, aligned_sched_shifted = transforms.align_measures(
      [sched, sched_shifted],
      align_all=False,
  )

  assert aligned_sched != aligned_sched_shifted
  ```

  **Parameters**

  *   **schedules** (`Iterable`\[`Union`\[`Schedule`, `Instruction`]]) – Collection of schedules to be aligned together
  *   **inst\_map** (`Optional`\[`InstructionScheduleMap`]) – Mapping of circuit operations to pulse schedules
  *   **cal\_gate** (`str`) – The name of the gate to inspect for the calibration time
  *   **max\_calibration\_duration** (`Optional`\[`int`]) – If provided, inst\_map and cal\_gate will be ignored
  *   **align\_time** (`Optional`\[`int`]) – If provided, this will be used as final align time.
  *   **align\_all** (`Optional`\[`bool`]) – Shift all instructions in the schedule such that they maintain their relative alignment with the shifted acquisition instruction. If `False` only the acquisition and measurement pulse instructions will be shifted.

  **Return type**

  `List`\[`Schedule`]

  **Returns**

  The input list of schedules transformed to have their measurements aligned.

  **Raises**

  [**PulseError**](qiskit.pulse.PulseError "qiskit.pulse.PulseError") – If the provided alignment time is negative.
