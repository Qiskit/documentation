# UnitaryOverlap

<Class id="qiskit.circuit.library.UnitaryOverlap" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/main/qiskit/circuit/library/overlap.py#L22-L91" signature="qiskit.circuit.library.UnitaryOverlap(unitary1, unitary2, prefix1='p1', prefix2='p2', insert_barrier=False)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: [`QuantumCircuit`](qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.quantumcircuit.QuantumCircuit")

  Circuit that returns the overlap between two unitaries $U_2^{\dag} U_1$.

  The input quantum circuits must represent unitary operations, since they must be invertible. If the inputs will have parameters, they are replaced by [`ParameterVector`](qiskit.circuit.ParameterVector "qiskit.circuit.ParameterVector")s with names “p1” (for circuit `unitary1`) and “p2” (for circuit `unitary_2`) in the output circuit.

  This circuit is usually employed in computing the fidelity:

$$
\left|\langle 0| U_2^{\dag} U_1|0\rangle\right|^{2}
$$

  by computing the probability of being in the all-zeros bit-string, or equivalently, the expectation value of projector $|0\rangle\langle 0|$.

  Example:

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2, UnitaryOverlap
  from qiskit.primitives import Sampler

  # get two circuit to prepare states of which we compute the overlap
  circuit = EfficientSU2(2, reps=1)
  unitary1 = circuit.assign_parameters(np.random.random(circuit.num_parameters))
  unitary2 = circuit.assign_parameters(np.random.random(circuit.num_parameters))

  # create the overlap circuit
  overlap = UnitaryOverlap(unitary1, unitary2)

  # sample from the overlap
  sampler = Sampler(options={"shots": 100})
  result = sampler.run(overlap).result()

  # the fidelity is the probability to measure 0
  fidelity = result.quasi_dists[0].get(0, 0)
  ```

  <Admonition title="Deprecated since version 2.1" type="danger">
    The class `qiskit.circuit.library.overlap.UnitaryOverlap` is deprecated as of Qiskit 2.1. It will be removed in Qiskit 3.0. Use qiskit.circuit.library.unitary\_overlap instead.

  **Parameters**

  *   **unitary1** ([*QuantumCircuit*](qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.quantumcircuit.QuantumCircuit")) – Unitary acting on the ket vector.
  *   **unitary2** ([*QuantumCircuit*](qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit "qiskit.circuit.quantumcircuit.QuantumCircuit")) – Unitary whose inverse operates on the bra vector.
  *   **prefix1** ([*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.13)")) – The name of the parameter vector associated to `unitary1`, if it is parameterized. Defaults to `"p1"`.
  *   **prefix2** ([*str*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str "(in Python v3.13)")) – The name of the parameter vector associated to `unitary2`, if it is parameterized. Defaults to `"p2"`.
  *   **insert\_barrier** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")) – Whether to insert a barrier between the two unitaries.

  **Raises**

  *   [**CircuitError**](circuit#qiskit.circuit.CircuitError "qiskit.circuit.CircuitError") – Number of qubits in `unitary1` and `unitary2` does not match.
  *   [**CircuitError**](circuit#qiskit.circuit.CircuitError "qiskit.circuit.CircuitError") – Inputs contain measurements and/or resets.
