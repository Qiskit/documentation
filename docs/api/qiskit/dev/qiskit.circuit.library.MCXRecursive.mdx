# MCXRecursive

<Class id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/main/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/x.py#L1328-L1398" signature="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive(num_ctrl_qubits=None, label=None, ctrl_state=None, *, duration=None, unit='dt', _base_label=None)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: [`MCXGate`](qiskit.circuit.library.MCXGate "qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates.x.MCXGate")

  Implement the multi-controlled X gate using recursion.

  Using a single clean ancilla qubit, the multi-controlled X gate is split into four sub-registers, each one of them uses the V-chain method.

  The method is based on Lemma 9 of \[2], first shown in Lemma 7.3 of \[1].

  <Admonition title="Deprecated since version 1.3_pending" type="danger">
    The class `qiskit.circuit.library.standard_gates.x.MCXRecursive` is pending deprecation as of qiskit 1.3. It will be marked deprecated in a future release, and then removed no earlier than 3 months after the release date. It is recommended to use MCXGate and let HighLevelSynthesis choose the best synthesis method depending on the number of ancilla qubits available. If this specific synthesis method is required, one can specify it using the high-level-synthesis plugin ‘1\_clean\_b95’ for MCX gates, or, alternatively, one can use synth\_mcx\_1\_clean to construct the gate directly.

  ## Attributes

  ### base\_class

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.base_class">
    Get the base class of this instruction. This is guaranteed to be in the inheritance tree of `self`.

    The “base class” of an instruction is the lowest class in its inheritance tree that the object should be considered entirely compatible with for \_all\_ circuit applications. This typically means that the subclass is defined purely to offer some sort of programmer convenience over the base class, and the base class is the “true” class for a behavioral perspective. In particular, you should *not* override [`base_class`](#qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.base_class "qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.base_class") if you are defining a custom version of an instruction that will be implemented differently by hardware, such as an alternative measurement strategy, or a version of a parametrized gate with a particular set of parameters for the purposes of distinguishing it in a [`Target`](qiskit.transpiler.Target "qiskit.transpiler.Target") from the full parametrized gate.

    This is often exactly equivalent to `type(obj)`, except in the case of singleton instances of standard-library instructions. These singleton instances are special subclasses of their base class, and this property will return that base. For example:

    ```python
    >>> isinstance(XGate(), XGate)
    True
    >>> type(XGate()) is XGate
    False
    >>> XGate().base_class is XGate
    True
    ```

    In general, you should not rely on the precise class of an instruction; within a given circuit, it is expected that `Instruction.name` should be a more suitable discriminator in most situations.

  ### condition

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.condition">
    The classical condition on the instruction.
  </Attribute>

  ### condition\_bits

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.condition_bits">
    Get Clbits in condition.
  </Attribute>

  ### ctrl\_state

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.ctrl_state">
    Return the control state of the gate as a decimal integer.
  </Attribute>

  ### decompositions

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.decompositions">
    Get the decompositions of the instruction from the SessionEquivalenceLibrary.
  </Attribute>

  ### definition

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.definition">
    Return definition in terms of other basic gates. If the gate has open controls, as determined from [`ctrl_state`](#qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.ctrl_state "qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.ctrl_state"), the returned definition is conjugated with X without changing the internal `_definition`.
  </Attribute>

  ### duration

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.duration">
    Get the duration.

    <Admonition title="Deprecated since version 1.3.0" type="danger">
      The property `qiskit.circuit.instruction.Instruction.duration` is deprecated as of qiskit 1.3.0. It will be removed in Qiskit 2.0.0.
    </Admonition>
  </Attribute>

  ### label

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.label">

  </Attribute>

  ### mutable

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.mutable">
    Is this instance is a mutable unique instance or not.

    If this attribute is `False` the gate instance is a shared singleton and is not mutable.
  </Attribute>

  ### name

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.name">
    Get name of gate. If the gate has open controls the gate name will become:

    > \<original\_name\_o\<ctrl\_state>

    where \<original\_name> is the gate name for the default case of closed control qubits and \<ctrl\_state> is the integer value of the control state for the gate.

  </Attribute>

  ### unit

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.unit">
    Get the time unit of duration.

    <Admonition title="Deprecated since version 1.3.0" type="danger">
      The property `qiskit.circuit.instruction.Instruction.unit` is deprecated as of qiskit 1.3.0. It will be removed in Qiskit 2.0.0.

  ## Methods

  ### get\_num\_ancilla\_qubits

  <Function id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.get_num_ancilla_qubits" github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/main/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/x.py#L1372-L1375" signature="get_num_ancilla_qubits(num_ctrl_qubits, mode='recursion')" modifiers="static">
    Get the number of required ancilla qubits.
  </Function>

  ### inverse

  <Function id="qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive.inverse" github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/main/qiskit/circuit/library/standard_gates/x.py#L1377-L1389" signature="inverse(annotated=False)">
    Invert this gate. The MCX is its own inverse.

    **Parameters**

    **annotated** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")) – when set to `True`, this is typically used to return an [`AnnotatedOperation`](qiskit.circuit.AnnotatedOperation "qiskit.circuit.AnnotatedOperation") with an inverse modifier set instead of a concrete [`Gate`](qiskit.circuit.Gate "qiskit.circuit.Gate"). However, for this class this argument is ignored as this gate is self-inverse.

    **Returns**

    inverse gate (self-inverse).

    **Return type**

    [MCXRecursive](#qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive "qiskit.circuit.library.MCXRecursive")
