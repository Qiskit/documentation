# AndGate

<Class id="qiskit.circuit.library.AndGate" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/1.3/qiskit/circuit/library/boolean_logic/quantum_and.py#L107-L200" signature="qiskit.circuit.library.AndGate(num_variable_qubits, flags=None)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: [`Gate`](qiskit.circuit.Gate "qiskit.circuit.gate.Gate")

  A gate representing the logical AND operation on a number of qubits.

  For the AND operation the state $|1\rangle$ is interpreted as `True`. The result qubit is flipped, if the state of all variable qubits is `True`. In this format, the AND operation equals a multi-controlled X gate, which is controlled on all variable qubits. Using a list of flags however, qubits can be skipped or negated. Practically, the flags allow to skip controls or to apply pre- and post-X gates to the negated qubits.

  The AndGate gate without special flags equals the multi-controlled-X gate:

  Using flags we can negate qubits or skip them. For instance, if we have 5 qubits and want to return `True` if the first qubit is `False` and the last two are `True` we use the flags `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.

  **Parameters**

  *   **num\_variable\_qubits** ([*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)")) – The qubits of which the AND is computed. The result will be written into an additional result qubit.
  *   **flags** ([*list*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list "(in Python v3.13)")*\[*[*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)")*] | None*) – A list of +1/0/-1 marking negations or omissions of qubits.

  ## Attributes

  ### base\_class

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.AndGate.base_class">
    Get the base class of this instruction. This is guaranteed to be in the inheritance tree of `self`.

    The “base class” of an instruction is the lowest class in its inheritance tree that the object should be considered entirely compatible with for \_all\_ circuit applications. This typically means that the subclass is defined purely to offer some sort of programmer convenience over the base class, and the base class is the “true” class for a behavioral perspective. In particular, you should *not* override [`base_class`](#qiskit.circuit.library.AndGate.base_class "qiskit.circuit.library.AndGate.base_class") if you are defining a custom version of an instruction that will be implemented differently by hardware, such as an alternative measurement strategy, or a version of a parametrized gate with a particular set of parameters for the purposes of distinguishing it in a [`Target`](qiskit.transpiler.Target "qiskit.transpiler.Target") from the full parametrized gate.

    This is often exactly equivalent to `type(obj)`, except in the case of singleton instances of standard-library instructions. These singleton instances are special subclasses of their base class, and this property will return that base. For example:

    ```python
    >>> isinstance(XGate(), XGate)
    True
    >>> type(XGate()) is XGate
    False
    >>> XGate().base_class is XGate
    True
    ```

    In general, you should not rely on the precise class of an instruction; within a given circuit, it is expected that `Instruction.name` should be a more suitable discriminator in most situations.

    Return the name.
  </Attribute>

  ### num\_clbits

  <Attribute id="qiskit.circuit.library.AndGate.num_clbits">

  ## Methods

  ### inverse

  <Function id="qiskit.circuit.library.AndGate.inverse" github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/1.3/qiskit/circuit/library/boolean_logic/quantum_and.py#L181-L193" signature="inverse(annotated=False)">
    Return inverted AND gate (itself).

    **Parameters**

    **annotated** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")) – when set to `True`, this is typically used to return an [`AnnotatedOperation`](qiskit.circuit.AnnotatedOperation "qiskit.circuit.AnnotatedOperation") with an inverse modifier set instead of a concrete [`Gate`](qiskit.circuit.Gate "qiskit.circuit.Gate"). However, for this class this argument is ignored as this gate is self-inverse.

    **Returns**

    inverse gate (self-inverse).

    **Return type**

    [AndGate](#qiskit.circuit.library.AndGate "qiskit.circuit.library.AndGate")
