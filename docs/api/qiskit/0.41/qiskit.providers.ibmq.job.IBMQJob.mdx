# IBMQJob

<Class id="qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider/tree/stable/0.20/qiskit/providers/ibmq/job/ibmqjob.py" signature="IBMQJob(backend, api_client, job_id, creation_date, status, kind=None, name=None, time_per_step=None, result=None, qobj=None, error=None, tags=None, run_mode=None, share_level=None, client_info=None, experiment_id=None, **kwargs)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: [`qiskit.providers.job.JobV1`](qiskit.providers.JobV1 "qiskit.providers.job.JobV1")

  Representation of a job that executes on an IBM Quantum Experience backend.

  The job may be executed on a simulator or a real device. A new `IBMQJob` instance is returned when you call `IBMQBackend.run()` to submit a job to a particular backend.

  If the job is successfully submitted, you can inspect the job’s status by calling [`status()`](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob#status "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.status"). Job status can be one of the [`JobStatus`](qiskit.providers.JobStatus "qiskit.providers.JobStatus") members. For example:

  ```python
  from qiskit.providers.jobstatus import JobStatus

  job = backend.run(...)

  try:
      job_status = job.status()  # Query the backend server for job status.
      if job_status is JobStatus.RUNNING:
          print("The job is still running")
  except IBMQJobApiError as ex:
      print("Something wrong happened!: {}".format(ex))
  ```

  <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
    An error may occur when querying the remote server to get job information. The most common errors are temporary network failures and server errors, in which case an [`IBMQJobApiError`](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError") is raised. These errors usually clear quickly, so retrying the operation is likely to succeed.
  </Admonition>

  Some of the methods in this class are blocking, which means control may not be returned immediately. [`result()`](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob#result "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.result") is an example of a blocking method:

  ```python
  job = backend.run(...)

  try:
      job_result = job.result()  # It will block until the job finishes.
      print("The job finished with result {}".format(job_result))
  except JobError as ex:
      print("Something wrong happened!: {}".format(ex))
  ```

  Job information retrieved from the server is attached to the `IBMQJob` instance as attributes. Given that Qiskit and the server can be updated independently, some of these attributes might be deprecated or experimental. Supported attributes can be retrieved via methods. For example, you can use [`creation_date()`](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob#creation_date "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.creation_date") to retrieve the job creation date, which is a supported attribute.

    Obtain the latest job information from the server.

    This method may add additional attributes to this job instance, if new information becomes available.

    **Raises**

    [**IBMQJobApiError**](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError") – If an unexpected error occurred when communicating with the server.

  </Admonition>

  ### result

  <Function id="qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.result" signature="IBMQJob.result(timeout=None, wait=5, partial=False, refresh=False)">
    Return the result of the job.

    <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
      Some IBM Quantum Experience job results can only be read once. A second attempt to query the server for the same job will fail, since the job has already been “consumed”.

      The first call to this method in an `IBMQJob` instance will query the server and consume any available job results. Subsequent calls to that instance’s `result()` will also return the results, since they are cached. However, attempting to retrieve the results again in another instance or session might fail due to the job results having been consumed.
    </Admonition>

    <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
      When partial=True, this method will attempt to retrieve partial results of failed jobs. In this case, precaution should be taken when accessing individual experiments, as doing so might cause an exception. The `success` attribute of the returned [`Result`](qiskit.result.Result "qiskit.result.Result") instance can be used to verify whether it contains partial results.

      For example, if one of the experiments in the job failed, trying to get the counts of the unsuccessful experiment would raise an exception since there are no counts to return:

      ```python
      try:
          counts = result.get_counts("failed_experiment")
      except QiskitError:
          print("Experiment failed!")
      ```
    </Admonition>

    If the job failed, you can use [`error_message()`](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob#error_message "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.error_message") to get more information.

    **Parameters**

    *   **timeout** (`Optional`\[`float`]) – Number of seconds to wait for job.
    *   **wait** (`float`) – Time in seconds between queries.
    *   **partial** (`bool`) – If `True`, return partial results if possible.
    *   **refresh** (`bool`) – If `True`, re-query the server for the result. Otherwise return the cached value.

    **Return type**

    [`Result`](qiskit.result.Result "qiskit.result.result.Result")

    **Returns**

    Job result.

    **Raises**

    *   [**IBMQJobInvalidStateError**](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobInvalidStateError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobInvalidStateError") – If the job was cancelled.
    *   [**IBMQJobFailureError**](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobFailureError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobFailureError") – If the job failed.
    *   [**IBMQJobApiError**](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError") – If an unexpected error occurred when communicating with the server.

  ### time\_per\_step

  <Function id="qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.time_per_step" signature="IBMQJob.time_per_step()">
    Return the date and time information on each step of the job processing.

    The output dictionary contains the date and time information on each step of the job processing, in local time. The keys of the dictionary are the names of the steps, and the values are the date and time data, as a datetime object with local timezone info. For example:

    ```python
    {'CREATING': datetime(2020, 2, 13, 15, 19, 25, 717000, tzinfo=tzlocal(),
     'CREATED': datetime(2020, 2, 13, 15, 19, 26, 467000, tzinfo=tzlocal(),
     'VALIDATING': datetime(2020, 2, 13, 15, 19, 26, 527000, tzinfo=tzlocal()}
    ```

    **Return type**

    `Optional`\[`Dict`]

    **Returns**

    Date and time information on job processing steps, in local time, or `None` if the information is not yet available.

  ### update\_name

  <Function id="qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.update_name" signature="IBMQJob.update_name(name)">
    Update the name associated with this job.

    **Parameters**

    **name** (`str`) – The new name for this job.

    **Return type**

    `str`

    **Returns**

    The new name associated with this job.

    **Raises**

    *   [**IBMQJobApiError**](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError") – If an unexpected error occurred when communicating with the server or updating the job name.
    *   [**IBMQJobInvalidStateError**](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobInvalidStateError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobInvalidStateError") – If the input job name is not a string.

  ### update\_tags

  <Function id="qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.update_tags" signature="IBMQJob.update_tags(replacement_tags=None, additional_tags=None, removal_tags=None)">
    Update the tags associated with this job.

    When multiple parameters are specified, the parameters are processed in the following order:

    > 1.  replacement\_tags
    > 2.  additional\_tags
    > 3.  removal\_tags

    For example, if ‘new\_tag’ is specified for both additional\_tags and removal\_tags, then it is added and subsequently removed from the tags list, making it a “do nothing” operation.

    <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
      *   Some tags, such as those starting with `ibmq_jobset`, are used internally by ibmq-provider and therefore cannot be modified.
      *   When removing tags, if the job does not have a specified tag, it will be ignored.
    </Admonition>

    **Parameters**

    *   **replacement\_tags** (`Optional`\[`List`\[`str`]]) – The tags that should replace the current tags associated with this job.
    *   **additional\_tags** (`Optional`\[`List`\[`str`]]) – The new tags that should be added to the current tags associated with this job.
    *   **removal\_tags** (`Optional`\[`List`\[`str`]]) – The tags that should be removed from the current tags associated with this job.

    **Return type**

    `List`\[`str`]

    **Returns**

    The new tags associated with this job.

    **Raises**

    *   [**IBMQJobApiError**](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobApiError") – If an unexpected error occurred when communicating with the server or updating the job tags.
    *   [**IBMQJobInvalidStateError**](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobInvalidStateError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobInvalidStateError") – If none of the input parameters are specified or if any of the input parameters are invalid.

  ### wait\_for\_final\_state

  <Function id="qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJob.wait_for_final_state" signature="IBMQJob.wait_for_final_state(timeout=None, wait=None, callback=None)">
    Wait until the job progresses to a final state such as `DONE` or `ERROR`.

    **Parameters**

    *   **timeout** (`Optional`\[`float`]) – Seconds to wait for the job. If `None`, wait indefinitely.

    *   **wait** (`Optional`\[`float`]) – Seconds to wait between invoking the callback function. If `None`, the callback function is invoked only if job status or queue position has changed.

    *   **callback** (`Optional`\[`Callable`]) –

        Callback function invoked after each querying iteration. The following positional arguments are provided to the callback function:

        > *   job\_id: Job ID
        > *   job\_status: Status of the job from the last query.
        > *   job: This `IBMQJob` instance.

        In addition, the following keyword arguments are also provided:

        > *   queue\_info: A [`QueueInfo`](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.QueueInfo "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.QueueInfo") instance with job queue information, or `None` if queue information is unknown or not applicable. You can use the `to_dict()` method to convert the [`QueueInfo`](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.QueueInfo "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.QueueInfo") instance to a dictionary, if desired.

    **Raises**

    [**IBMQJobTimeoutError**](qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobTimeoutError "qiskit.providers.ibmq.job.IBMQJobTimeoutError") – if the job does not reach a final state before the specified timeout.

    **Return type**

    `None`
