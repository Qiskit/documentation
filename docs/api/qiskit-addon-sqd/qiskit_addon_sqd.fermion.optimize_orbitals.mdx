  Optimize orbitals to produce a minimal ground state.

  The process involves iterating over 3 steps:

  ## For `num_iters` iterations:

  *   Rotate the integrals with respect to the parameters, `k_flat`
  *   Diagonalize and approximate the groundstate energy and wavefunction amplitudes
  *   Optimize `k_flat` using gradient descent and the wavefunction amplitudes found in Step 2

  Refer to [Sec. II A 4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05068) for more detailed discussion on this orbital optimization technique.

  **Parameters**

  *   **bitstring\_matrix** ([*tuple*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple "(in Python v3.13)")*\[*[*ndarray*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray "(in NumPy v2.1)")*,* [*ndarray*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray "(in NumPy v2.1)")*] |* [*ndarray*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray "(in NumPy v2.1)")) –

      A set of configurations defining the subspace onto which the Hamiltonian will be projected and diagonalized. This is a 2D array of `bool` representations of bit values such that each row represents a single bitstring. The spin-up configurations should be specified by column indices in range `(N, N/2]`, and the spin-down configurations should be specified by column indices in range `(N/2, 0]`, where `N` is the number of qubits.

      (DEPRECATED) The configurations may also be specified by a length-2 tuple of sorted 1D arrays containing unsigned integer representations of the determinants. The two lists should represent the spin-up and spin-down orbitals, respectively.

  *   **hcore** ([*ndarray*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray "(in NumPy v2.1)")) – Core Hamiltonian matrix representing single-electron integrals

  *   **eri** ([*ndarray*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray "(in NumPy v2.1)")) – Electronic repulsion integrals representing two-electron integrals

  *   **k\_flat** ([*ndarray*](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray "(in NumPy v2.1)")) – 1D array defining the orbital transform. This array will be reshaped to be of shape (# orbitals, # orbitals) before being used as a similarity transform operator on the orbitals. Thus `len(k_flat)=# orbitals**2`.

  *   **open\_shell** ([*bool*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool "(in Python v3.13)")) – A flag specifying whether configurations from the left and right halves of the bitstrings should be kept separate. If `False`, CI strings from the left and right halves of the bitstrings are combined into a single set of unique configurations and used for both the alpha and beta subspaces.

  *   **spin\_sq** ([*float*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "(in Python v3.13)")) – Target value for the total spin squared for the ground state

  *   **num\_iters** ([*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)")) – The number of iterations of orbital optimization to perform

  *   **max\_davidson** ([*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)")) – The maximum number of cycles of Davidson’s algorithm to perform during diagonalization.

  *   **num\_steps\_grad** ([*int*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#int "(in Python v3.13)")) – The number of steps of gradient descent to perform during each optimization iteration

  *   **learning\_rate** ([*float*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float "(in Python v3.13)")) – The learning rate to use during gradient descent

  **Returns**

  *   The groundstate energy found during the last optimization iteration
  *   An optimized 1D array defining the orbital transform
  *   Average orbital occupancy

  **Return type**

  A tuple containing
