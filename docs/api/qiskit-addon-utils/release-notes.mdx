### Bug Fixes

*   Support circuits that include classical bits when slicing a circuit by gate types. See #115 \<[https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-utils/issues/115](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-utils/issues/115)> for details.

### Other Notes

*   This release adds support for Python 3.13. No code changes were necessary, so older releases are expected to work on Python 3.13 too.
