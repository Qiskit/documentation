# Migrate to using Qiskit Runtime primitives

This guide describes key patterns of behavior and use cases with code
examples to help you migrate code from the legacy `qiskit-ibmq-provider`
package to use the Qiskit Runtime primitives.

## Overview

There are two methods for accessing IBM Quantum&trade; systems. First, the `qiskit-ibm-provider` package provides the `backend.run()` interface, allowing direct access to IBM Quantum systems with no pre- or post-processing involved. This level of access is suitable for those users who want **precise control** over circuit execution and result processing. This level of access is needed for those at the level of kernel developer who are looking to develop, for example, circuit optimization routines or error mitigation techniques, or who want to characterize quantum systems.

In contrast, Qiskit Runtime is designed to **streamline algorithm and application construction** by removing the need for users to understand technical hardware and low-level software details. Advanced processing techniques for error suppression and mitigation are automatically applied, giving users high-fidelity results without the burden of having to code these routines themselves. Sessions within Qiskit Runtime allow users to run iterative algorithm circuits back to back, or batch collections of circuits without having to re-queue each job. This results in more efficient quantum processor use and reduces the time users spend running complex computations.

Primitives are the recommended tool to write quantum algorithms, as they
encapsulate common device queries seen in application packages and allow
for managed performance through the Qiskit Runtime service. However, if
your algorithm requires more granular information, such as pre-shot
measurements, the primitives might not provide the desired abstraction
level.

The Qiskit Runtime primitives implement the reference `Sampler` and
`Estimator` interfaces found in
[qiskit.primitives](../qiskit/primitives).
These interfaces let you switch between primitive implementations with
minimal code changes. Different primitive implementations can be found
in the `qiskit`, `qiskit_aer`, and `qiskit_ibm_runtime` libraries. Each
implementation serves a specific purpose:

-   The primitives in `qiskit` can perform local state vector
    simulations - useful for quickly prototyping algorithms.
-   The primitives in `qiskit_aer` give access to the local Aer
    simulators for tasks such as noisy simulation.
-   The primitives in `qiskit_ibm_runtime` provide access to cloud
    simulators and real hardware through the Qiskit Runtime service.
    They include exclusive features such as built-in circuit
    optimization and error mitigation support.

<Admonition type="note">
    The **only primitives that provide access to the Qiskit Runtime service** are those imported from `qiskit_ibm_runtime` (Qiskit Runtime Primitives).
</Admonition>

When migrating, the key to writing an equivalent algorithm using
primitives is to first identify what is the minimal unit of information
your algorithm is based on:

-   If it uses an **expectation value**, you will need an `Estimator`.
-   If it uses a **probability distribution** (from sampling the device), you will need a `Sampler`.

After determining which primitive to use, identify where the algorithm
accesses the system. Look for the call to `backend.run()`. Next, you
will replace this call with the respective primitive call, as shown in
the following examples.

This guide is for algorithm developers who need to refactor algorithms to use primitives instead of `backend.run()`. See examples here:

    -   [Update code that performs circuit sampling](qiskit-runtime-examples#sampler-algorithm)
    -   [Update code that calculates expectation values](qiskit-runtime-examples#estimator-algorithm)

The following topics are use cases with code migration examples:

-   [Update parameter values while running](#parm-circ)

## FAQs

Users might have the following questions when planning to migrate their
code to Qiskit Runtime:

<details>
<summary>Which channel should I use?</summary>

After deciding to use Qiskit Runtime primitives, the user must determine
whether to access Qiskit Runtime through IBM Cloud or IBM Quantum
Platform. Some information that might help you decide includes:

- The available plans:
   - Qiskit Runtime is available in both the Open (free access) or Premium (contract-based paid access) plan on IBM Quantum Platform. See [IBM Quantum access plans](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/access-plans) for details.
   - Qiskit Runtime is accessible through the Lite (free access) or Standard (pay-as-you-go access) plan in IBM Cloud. See [Qiskit Runtime plans](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-plans) on IBM Cloud for details.
- The use case requirements:
   - IBM Quantum Platform offers a visual circuit composer (Quantum Composer) and a Jupyter Notebook environment (Quantum Lab).
   - IBM Cloud offers a cloud native service that is ideal if users need to integrate quantum capabilities with other cloud services.

<details>
<summary>How do I set up my channel?</summary>

After deciding which channel to use to interact with Qiskit Runtime, you
can get set up on either platform by following the steps in [Install and set up.](../../start/install)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Should I modify the Qiskit Terra algorithms?</summary>

As of v0.22, [Qiskit Terra algorithms](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/tree/stable/0.46/qiskit/algorithms) use Qiskit Runtime primitives. Thus, there is no need for users to
modify amplitude estimators or any other Qiskit Terra algorithms.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which primitive should I use?</summary>

When choosing which primitive to use, you first need to understand
whether the algorithm uses a **quasi-probability distribution** sampled
from a quantum state (a list of quasi-probabilities), or an
**expectation value** of a certain observable with respect to a
quantum state (a real number).

A probability distribution is often of interest in optimization problems
that return a classical bit string, encoding a certain solution to a
problem at hand. In these cases, you might be interested in finding a
bit string that corresponds to a ket value with the largest probability
of being measured from a quantum state, for example.

An expectation value of an observable could be the target quantity in
scenarios where knowing a quantum state is not relevant. This often
occurs in optimization problems or chemistry applications. For example,
when trying to discover the extremal energy of a system.

## Migrate setup from qiskit-ibmq-provider

This guide describes how to migrate code from the legacy IBMQ provider
`qiskit-ibmq-provider` package to use Qiskit Runtime
`qiskit-ibm-runtime`. This guide includes instructions to
migrate legacy runtime programs to the new syntax. However, the ability
to use custom uploaded programs has been deprecated and has been replaced with Quantum Serverless patterns.  For instructions to migrate, see [Converting from Qiskit Runtime Programs.](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/migration/migration_from_qiskit_runtime_programs.html)

### Changes in Class name and location

The classes related to Qiskit Runtime that used to be included in
`qiskit-ibmq-provider` are now part of `qiskit-ibm-runtime`. Before, the
provider used to populate the `qiskit.providers.ibmq.runtime` namespace
with objects for Qiskit Runtime. These now live in the
`qiskit_ibm_runtime` module.

The module from which the classes are imported has changed. The
following table contains example access patterns in
`qiskit.providers.ibmq.runtime` and their new form in
`qiskit_ibm_runtime`:

| class in qiskit-ibmq-provider                    | class in qiskit-ibm-runtime               | Notes                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| qiskit.providers.ibmq.runtime.IBMRuntimeService  | qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService   | IBMRuntimeService class was removed from qiskit-ibm-runtime 0.6 and replaced by the new class in qiskit-ibm-runtime. |

### Import path

The import path has changed as follows:

**Legacy**

``` python
from qiskit import IBMQ
```

**Updated**

``` python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
```

### Save accounts

Use the updated code to work save accounts.

**Legacy**

``` python
IBMQ.save_account("<IQX_TOKEN>", overwrite=True)
```

**Updated** 

The new syntax accepts credentials for
Qiskit Runtime on IBM Cloud or IBM Quantum Platform. For more
information on retrieving account credentials, see [Install and set up](../../start/install).

``` python
# IBM Cloud channel

QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_cloud", token="<IBM Cloud API key>", instance="<IBM Cloud CRN>", overwrite=True)

# IBM Quantum channel; set to default 

QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_quantum", token="<IQP_TOKEN>", overwrite=True, default=true)
```

Additionally, you can now name your saved credentials and load the credentials by name.


``` python
# Save different accounts for open and premium access

QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_quantum", token="<IQX_TOKEN>", instance="h1/g1/p1", name="premium")
QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(channel="ibm_quantum", token="<IQX_TOKEN>", instance="h2/g2/p2", name="open")

# Load the "open" credentials

service = QiskitRuntimeService(name="open")
```

### Load accounts

Use the updated code to load accounts.

**Legacy**

``` python
IBMQ.load_account()
```

**Updated**

The new syntax combines the functionality from `load_account()` and
`get_provider()` in one statement. The `channel` input parameter is
optional. If multiple accounts have been saved in one device and no
`channel` is provided, the default is `"ibm_cloud"`.

``` python
# To access saved credentials for the IBM cloud channel
service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_cloud")

# To access saved credentials for the IBM quantum channel
service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum")
```


### Channel selection (get a provider)

Use the updated code to select a channel.

**Legacy**

``` python
provider = IBMQ.get_provider(project="my_project", group="my_group", hub="my_hub")
```

**Updated**

The new syntax combines the functionality from `load_account()` and
`get_provider()` in one statement. When using the `ibm_quantum` channel,
the `hub`, `group`, and `project` are specified through the new
`instance` keyword.

``` python
# To access saved credentials for the IBM quantum channel and select an instance
service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum", instance="my_hub/my_group/my_project")
```

### Get the system or simulator

Use the updated code to view systems and simulators.

**Legacy**

``` python
provider = IBMQ.get_provider(hub="h1", group="g1", project="p1")
backend = provider.get_backend("ibm_backend")
```

**Updated**

``` python
# You can specify the instance in service.backend() instead of initializing a new service
backend = service.backend("ibm_backend", instance="h1/g1/p1")
```

### Upload, view, or delete custom prototype programs

This function has been replaced with Quantum Serverless patterns.  For instructions to migrate, see [Converting from Qiskit Runtime Programs.](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/migration/migration_from_qiskit_runtime_programs.html)

## Parametrized circuits with primitives

Parametrized circuits are a commonly used tool for quantum algorithm
design. Because `backend.run()` did not accept parametrized
circuits, the parameter binding step had to be integrated in the
algorithm workflow. The primitives can perform the parameter binding
step internally, which results in a simplification of the algorithm-side
logic.

The following example summarizes the new workflow for managing
parametrized circuits.

### Example

Let's define a parametrized circuit:

``` python
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, ParameterVector

n = 3
thetas = ParameterVector('θ',n)

qc = QuantumCircuit(n, 1)
qc.h(0)

for i in range(n-1):
    qc.cx(i, i+1)

for i,t in enumerate(thetas):
    qc.rz(t, i)

for i in reversed(range(n-1)):
    qc.cx(i, i+1)

qc.h(0)
qc.measure(0, 0)

qc.draw()
```

We want to assign the following parameter values to the circuit:

``` python
import numpy as np
theta_values = [np.pi/2, np.pi/2, np.pi/2]
```

### Legacy

Previously, the parameter values had to be bound to their respective
circuit parameters prior to calling `backend.run()`.

``` python
from qiskit import Aer

bound_circuit = qc.bind_parameters(theta_values)
bound_circuit.draw()

backend = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
job = backend.run(bound_circuit)
counts = job.result().get_counts()
print(counts)
```

### Primitives

Now, the primitives take in parametrized circuits directly, together
with the parameter values, and the parameter assignment operation can be
performed more efficiently on the server side of the primitive.

This feature is particularly interesting when working with iterative
algorithms because the parametrized circuit remains unchanged between
calls while the parameter values change. The primitives can transpile
once and then cache the unbound circuit, using classical resources more
efficiently. Moreover, only the updated parameters are transferred to
the cloud, saving additional bandwidth.

``` python
from qiskit.primitives import Sampler

sampler = Sampler()
job = sampler.run(qc, theta_values)
result = job.result().quasi_dists
print(result)
```

## Algorithm tuning

One of the advantages of the primitives is that they abstract away the
circuit execution setup so that algorithm developers can focus on the
pure algorithmic components. However, sometimes, to get the most out of
an algorithm, you might want to tune certain primitive options. For details, see [Advanced runtime options](../../run/advanced-runtime-options).
