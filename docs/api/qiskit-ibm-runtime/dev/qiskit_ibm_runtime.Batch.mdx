# Batch

<Class id="qiskit_ibm_runtime.Batch" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/tree/main/qiskit_ibm_runtime/batch.py#L24-L119" signature="Batch(service=None, backend=None, max_time=None)" modifiers="class">
  Class for running jobs in batch execution mode.

  The `batch` mode is designed to efficiently perform experiments that comprise multiple independent jobs.

  **Using the `batch` mode provides the following benefits:**

  *   The jobs’ classical computation, such as compilation, is run in parallel. Thus, running multiple jobs in a batch is significantly faster than running them serially.
  *   There is usually minimal delay between job, which can help avoid drift.
  *   If you partition your workload into multiple jobs and run them in `batch` mode, you can get results from individual jobs, which makes them more flexible to work with. For example, if a job’s results do not meet your expectations, you can cancel the remaining jobs, or simply re-submit that individual job and avoid re-running the entire workload.

  All jobs need to be provided at the outset. To submit iterative jobs, use the `session` mode instead.

  You can open a Qiskit Runtime batch by using this `Batch` class, then submit jobs to one or more primitives.

  For example:

  ```python
  from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
  from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
  from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Batch, SamplerV2 as Sampler, QiskitRuntimeService

  service = QiskitRuntimeService()
  backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)
  pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)

  # generate fifty unique three-qubit random circuits
  circuits = [pm.run(random_circuit(3, 2, measure=True)) for _ in range(50)]

  # split up the list of circuits into partitions
  max_circuits = 10
  partitions = [circuits[i : i + max_circuits] for i in range(0, len(circuits), max_circuits)]

  # run the circuits in batched mode
  with Batch(backend=backend):
      sampler = Sampler()
      for partition in partitions:
          job = sampler.run(partition)
          pub_result = job.result()[0]
          print(f"Sampler job ID: {job.job_id()}")
          print(f"Counts for the first PUB: {pub_result.data.cr.get_counts()}")
  ```

  Batch constructor.

  **Parameters**

  *   **service** (`Optional`\[[`QiskitRuntimeService`](qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService "qiskit_ibm_runtime.qiskit_runtime_service.QiskitRuntimeService")]) – Optional instance of the `QiskitRuntimeService` class. If `None`, the service associated with the backend, if known, is used. Otherwise `QiskitRuntimeService()` is used to initialize your default saved account.
  *   **backend** (`Union`\[`str`, [`BackendV1`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.BackendV1 "(in Qiskit v1.1)"), [`BackendV2`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.BackendV2 "(in Qiskit v1.1)"), `None`]) – Optional instance of `Backend` class or backend string name.
  *   **max\_time** (`Union`\[`int`, `str`, `None`]) – Maximum amount of time a runtime session can be open before being forcibly closed. Can be specified as seconds (int) or a string like “2h 30m 40s”. This value must be less than the [system imposed maximum](/run/max-execution-time).

  **Raises**

  **ValueError** – If an input value is invalid.
