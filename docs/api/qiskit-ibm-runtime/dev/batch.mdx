# Batch

<Class id="qiskit_ibm_runtime.Batch" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/tree/main/qiskit_ibm_runtime/batch.py#L23-L117" signature="Batch(backend=None, max_time=None)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: [`Session`](session "qiskit_ibm_runtime.session.Session")

  Class for running jobs in batch execution mode.

  The `batch` mode is designed to efficiently perform experiments that comprise multiple independent jobs.

  **Using the `batch` mode provides the following benefits:**

  *   The jobs’ classical computation, such as compilation, is run in parallel. Thus, running multiple jobs in a batch is significantly faster than running them serially.
  *   There is usually minimal delay between job, which can help avoid drift.
  *   If you partition your workload into multiple jobs and run them in `batch` mode, you can get results from individual jobs, which makes them more flexible to work with. For example, if a job’s results do not meet your expectations, you can cancel the remaining jobs, or simply re-submit that individual job and avoid re-running the entire workload.

  Batch mode can shorten processing time if all jobs are provided at the outset. If you want to submit iterative jobs, use `session` mode instead.

  You can open a Qiskit Runtime batch by using this `Batch` class, then submit jobs to one or more primitives.

  For example:

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  from qiskit.circuit.library import IQP
  from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
  from qiskit.quantum_info import random_hermitian
  from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, SamplerV2 as Sampler, Batch

  n_qubits = 127

  service = QiskitRuntimeService()
  backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False, min_num_qubits=n_qubits)

  rng = np.random.default_rng()
  mats = [np.real(random_hermitian(n_qubits, seed=rng)) for _ in range(30)]
  circuits = [IQP(mat) for mat in mats]
  for circuit in circuits:
      circuit.measure_all()

  pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)
  isa_circuits = pm.run(circuits)

  max_circuits = 10
  all_partitioned_circuits = []
  for i in range(0, len(isa_circuits), max_circuits):
      all_partitioned_circuits.append(isa_circuits[i : i + max_circuits])
  jobs = []
  start_idx = 0

  with Batch(backend=backend):
      sampler = Sampler()
      for partitioned_circuits in all_partitioned_circuits:
          job = sampler.run(partitioned_circuits)
          jobs.append(job)
  ```

  Batch constructor.

  **Parameters**

  *   **backend** ([*BackendV2*](/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.BackendV2 "(in Qiskit v2.0)") *| None*) – Instance of `Backend` class.
  *   **max\_time** (*int | str | None*) – Maximum amount of time a runtime session can be open before being forcibly closed. Can be specified as seconds (int) or a string like “2h 30m 40s”. This value must be less than the [system imposed maximum](/guides/max-execution-time).
