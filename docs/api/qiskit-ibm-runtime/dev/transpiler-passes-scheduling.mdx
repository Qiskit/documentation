# Transpiler scheduling passes

`qiskit_ibm_runtime.transpiler.passes.scheduling`

A collection of scheduling passes for working with IBM Quantum’s next-generation backends that support advanced “dynamic circuit” capabilities. Ie., circuits with support for classical control-flow/feedback based off of measurement results.

<Admonition title="Warning" type="caution">
  You should not mix these scheduling passes with Qiskit’s built in scheduling passes as they will negatively interact with the scheduling routines for dynamic circuits. This includes setting `scheduling_method` in [`transpile()`](/api/qiskit/compiler#qiskit.compiler.transpile "(in Qiskit v2.0)") or `generate_preset_pass_manager()`.

## Example usage

Below we demonstrate how to schedule and pad a teleportation circuit with delays for a dynamic circuit backend’s execution model:

```python
from qiskit.circuit import ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister
from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
from qiskit.transpiler.passmanager import PassManager

from qiskit_ibm_runtime.transpiler.passes.scheduling import DynamicCircuitInstructionDurations
from qiskit_ibm_runtime.transpiler.passes.scheduling import ALAPScheduleAnalysis
from qiskit_ibm_runtime.transpiler.passes.scheduling import PadDelay
from qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider import FakeJakartaV2

backend = FakeJakartaV2()

# Use this duration class to get appropriate durations for dynamic
# circuit backend scheduling
durations = DynamicCircuitInstructionDurations.from_backend(backend)
# Generate the main Qiskit transpile passes.
pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(optimization_level=1, backend=backend)
# Configure the as-late-as-possible scheduling pass
pm.scheduling = PassManager([ALAPScheduleAnalysis(durations), PadDelay(durations)])

qr = QuantumRegister(3)
crz = ClassicalRegister(1, name="crz")
crx = ClassicalRegister(1, name="crx")
result = ClassicalRegister(1, name="result")

teleport = QuantumCircuit(qr, crz, crx, result, name="Teleport")

teleport.h(qr[1])
teleport.cx(qr[1], qr[2])
teleport.cx(qr[0], qr[1])
teleport.h(qr[0])
teleport.measure(qr[0], crz)
teleport.measure(qr[1], crx)
with teleport.if_test((crz, 1)):
    teleport.z(qr[2])
with teleport.if_test((crx, 1)):
    teleport.x(qr[2])
teleport.measure(qr[2], result)

# Transpile.
scheduled_teleport = pm.run(teleport)

scheduled_teleport.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

Instead of padding with delays we may also insert a dynamical decoupling sequence using the [`PadDynamicalDecoupling`](transpiler-passes-scheduling-pad-dynamical-decoupling "qiskit_ibm_runtime.transpiler.passes.scheduling.PadDynamicalDecoupling") pass as shown below:

```python
from qiskit.circuit.library import XGate

from qiskit_ibm_runtime.transpiler.passes.scheduling import PadDynamicalDecoupling


dd_sequence = [XGate(), XGate()]

pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(optimization_level=1, backend=backend)
pm.scheduling = PassManager(
    [
        ALAPScheduleAnalysis(durations),
        PadDynamicalDecoupling(durations, dd_sequence),
    ]
)

dd_teleport = pm.run(teleport)

dd_teleport.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-2.avif)

When compiling a circuit with Qiskit, it is more efficient and more robust to perform all the transformations in a single transpilation. This has been done above by extending Qiskit’s preset pass managers. For example, Qiskit’s [`transpile()`](/api/qiskit/compiler#qiskit.compiler.transpile "(in Qiskit v2.0)") function internally builds its pass set by using `generate_preset_pass_manager()`. This returns instances of [`StagedPassManager`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.StagedPassManager "(in Qiskit v2.0)"), which can be extended.

## Exploiting IBM backend’s local parallel “fast-path”

IBM quantum hardware supports a localized “fast-path” which enables a block of gates applied to a *single qubit* that are conditional on an immediately predecessor measurement *of the same qubit* to be completed with lower latency. The hardware is also able to do this in *parallel* on disjoint qubits that satisfy this condition.

For example, the conditional gates below are performed in parallel with lower latency as the measurements flow directly into the conditional blocks which in turn only apply gates to the same measurement qubit.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.measure(1, 1)
# Conditional blocks will be performed in parallel in the hardware
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    qc.x(0)
with qc.if_test((1, 1)):
    qc.x(1)

qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-3.avif)

The circuit below will not use the fast-path as the conditional gate is on a different qubit than the measurement qubit.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.measure(0, 0)
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    qc.x(1)

qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-4.avif)

Similarly, the circuit below contains gates on multiple qubits and will not be performed using the fast-path.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.measure(0, 0)
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    qc.x(0)
    qc.x(1)

qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-5.avif)

A fast-path block may contain multiple gates as long as they are on the fast-path qubit. If there are multiple fast-path blocks being performed in parallel each block will be padded out to the duration of the longest block.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.measure(1, 1)
# Conditional blocks will be performed in parallel in the hardware
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    qc.x(0)
    # Will be padded out to a duration of 1600 on the backend.
with qc.if_test((1, 1)):
    qc.delay(1600, 1)

qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-6.avif)

This behavior is also applied to the else condition of a fast-path eligible branch.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
qc.measure(0, 0)
# Conditional blocks will be performed in parallel in the hardware
with qc.if_test((0, 1)) as else_:
    qc.x(0)
    # Will be padded out to a duration of 1600 on the backend.
with else_:
    qc.delay(1600, 0)

qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-7.avif)

If a single measurement result is used with several conditional blocks, if there is a fast-path eligible block it will be applied followed by the non-fast-path blocks which will execute with the standard higher latency conditional branch.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.measure(0, 0)
# Conditional blocks will be performed in parallel in the hardware
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    # Uses fast-path
    qc.x(0)
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    # Does not use fast-path
    qc.x(1)

qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-8.avif)

If you wish to prevent the usage of the fast-path you may insert a barrier between the measurement and the conditional branch.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 2)
qc.measure(0, 0)
# Barrier prevents the fast-path.
qc.barrier()
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    qc.x(0)

qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-9.avif)

Conditional measurements are not eligible for the fast-path.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 2)
qc.measure(0, 0)
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    # Does not use the fast-path
    qc.measure(0, 1)

qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-10.avif)

Similarly nested control-flow is not eligible.

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
qc.measure(0, 0)
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    # Does not use the fast-path
    qc.x(0)
    with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
        qc.x(0)

qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-11.avif)

The scheduler is aware of the fast-path behavior and will not insert delays on idle qubits in blocks that satisfy the fast-path conditions so as to avoid preventing the backend compiler from performing the necessary optimizations to utilize the fast-path. If there are fast-path blocks that will be performed in parallel they currently *will not* be padded out by the scheduler to ensure they are of the same duration in Qiskit

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.measure(1, 1)
with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
    qc.x(0)
    # Is currently not padded to ensure
    # a duration of 1000. If you desire
    # this you would need to manually add
    # qc.delay(840, 0)
with qc.if_test((1, 1)):
    qc.delay(1000, 0)


qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-12.avif)

```python
dd_sequence = [XGate(), XGate()]

pm = PassManager(
    [
        ALAPScheduleAnalysis(durations),
        PadDynamicalDecoupling(durations, dd_sequence),
    ]
)

qc_dd = pm.run(qc)
qc_dd.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
```

![Circuit diagram output by the previous code.](/images/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/dev/qiskit_ibm_runtime-transpiler-passes-scheduling-13.avif)

<Admonition title="Note" type="note">
  If there are qubits that are *not* involved in a fast-path decision it is not currently possible to use them in a fast-path branch in parallel with the fast-path qubits resulting from a measurement. This will be revised in the future as we further improve these capabilities.

  For example:

  ```python
  qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 2)
  qc.x(1)
  qc.measure(0, 0)
  with qc.if_test((0, 1)):
      qc.x(0)
  # Qubit 1 sits idle throughout the fast-path decision
  with qc.if_test((1, 0)):
      # Qubit 2 is idle but there is no measurement
      # to make it fast-path eligible. This will
      # however avoid a communication event in the hardware
      # since the condition is compile time evaluated.
      qc.x(2)

  qc.draw(output="mpl", style="iqp")
  ```
