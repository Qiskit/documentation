# Session

<Class id="qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/tree/stable/0.42/qiskit_ibm_runtime/session.py#L46-L395" signature="Session(backend, max_time=None, *, create_new=True)" modifiers="class">
  Bases: `object`

  Class for creating a Qiskit Runtime session.

  A Qiskit Runtime `session` allows you to group a collection of iterative calls to the quantum computer. A session is started when the first job within the session is started. Subsequent jobs within the session are prioritized by the scheduler.

  You can open a Qiskit Runtime session using this `Session` class and submit jobs to one or more primitives.

  For example:

  ```python
  from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister
  from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
  from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, SamplerV2 as Sampler

  service = QiskitRuntimeService()
  backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)

  # Bell Circuit
  qr = QuantumRegister(2, name="qr")
  cr = ClassicalRegister(2, name="cr")
  qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr, name="bell")
  qc.h(qr[0])
  qc.cx(qr[0], qr[1])
  qc.measure(qr, cr)

  pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)
  isa_circuit = pm.run(qc)

  with Session(backend=backend) as session:
      sampler = Sampler(mode=session)
      job = sampler.run([isa_circuit])
      pub_result = job.result()[0]
      print(f"Sampler job ID: {job.job_id()}")
      print(f"Counts: {pub_result.data.cr.get_counts()}")
  ```

  Session constructor.

  **Parameters**

  *   **backend** (*BackendV2*) – Instance of `Backend` class.
  *   **max\_time** (*Optional\[Union\[int, str]]*) – Maximum amount of time, a runtime session can be open before being forcibly closed. Can be specified as seconds (int) or a string like “2h 30m 40s”. This value must be less than the [system imposed maximum](/docs/guides/max-execution-time).
  *   **create\_new** (*Optional\[bool]*) – If True, the POST session API endpoint will be called to create a new session. Prevents creating a new session when `from_id()` is called.

  **Raises**

  **ValueError** – If an input value is invalid.

    Close the session so new jobs will no longer be accepted, but existing queued or running jobs will run to completion. The session will be terminated once there are no more pending jobs.

    **Return type**

    None
  </Function>

  ### details

  <Function id="qiskit_ibm_runtime.Session.details" github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/tree/stable/0.42/qiskit_ibm_runtime/session.py#L256-L300" signature="details()">
    Return session details.

    **Returns**

    A dictionary with the sessions details.

    *   `id`: id of the session.
    *   `backend_name`: backend used for the session.
    *   `interactive_timeout`: The maximum idle time (in seconds) between jobs that is allowed to occur before the session is deactivated.
    *   `max_time`: Maximum allowed time (in seconds) for the session, subject to plan limits.
    *   `active_timeout`: The maximum time (in seconds) a session can stay active.
    *   `state`: State of the session - open, active, inactive, or closed.
    *   `accepting_jobs`: Whether or not the session is accepting jobs.
    *   `last_job_started`: Timestamp of when the last job in the session started.
    *   `last_job_completed`: Timestamp of when the last job in the session completed.
    *   `started_at`: Timestamp of when the session was started.
    *   `closed_at`: Timestamp of when the session was closed.

    new_session = Session.from_id(existing_session_id, service)
    ```

    **Parameters**
