# Batch

<Class id="qiskit_ibm_runtime.Batch" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/tree/stable/0.29/qiskit_ibm_runtime/batch.py#L24-L141" signature="Batch(service=None, backend=None, max_time=None)" modifiers="class">
  Class for running jobs in batch execution mode.

  The `batch` mode is designed to efficiently perform experiments that comprise multiple independent jobs.

  **Using the `batch` mode provides the following benefits:**

  *   The jobs’ classical computation, such as compilation, is run in parallel. Thus, running multiple jobs in a batch is significantly faster than running them serially.
  *   There is usually minimal delay between job, which can help avoid drift.
  *   If you partition your workload into multiple jobs and run them in `batch` mode, you can get results from individual jobs, which makes them more flexible to work with. For example, if a job’s results do not meet your expectations, you can cancel the remaining jobs, or simply re-submit that individual job and avoid re-running the entire workload.

  Batch mode can shorten processing time if all jobs are provided at the outset. If you want to submit iterative jobs, use `session` mode instead.

  You can open a Qiskit Runtime batch by using this `Batch` class, then submit jobs to one or more primitives.

  For example:

  ```python
  import numpy as np
  from qiskit.circuit.library import IQP
  from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager
  from qiskit.quantum_info import random_hermitian
  from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, SamplerV2 as Sampler, Batch

  n_qubits = 127

  service = QiskitRuntimeService()
  backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False, min_num_qubits=n_qubits)

  rng = np.random.default_rng()
  mats = [np.real(random_hermitian(n_qubits, seed=rng)) for _ in range(30)]
  circuits = [IQP(mat) for mat in mats]
  for circuit in circuits:
      circuit.measure_all()

  pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)
  isa_circuits = pm.run(circuits)

  max_circuits = 10
  all_partitioned_circuits = []
  for i in range(0, len(isa_circuits), max_circuits):
      all_partitioned_circuits.append(isa_circuits[i : i + max_circuits])
  jobs = []
  start_idx = 0

  with Batch(backend=backend):
      sampler = Sampler()
      for partitioned_circuits in all_partitioned_circuits:
          job = sampler.run(partitioned_circuits)
          jobs.append(job)
  ```

  Batch constructor.

  **Parameters**

  *   **service** (`Optional`\[[`QiskitRuntimeService`](qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService "qiskit_ibm_runtime.qiskit_runtime_service.QiskitRuntimeService")]) – (DEPRECATED) Optional instance of the `QiskitRuntimeService` class. If `None`, the service associated with the backend, if known, is used. Otherwise `QiskitRuntimeService()` is used to initialize your default saved account.
  *   **backend** (`Union`\[`str`, [`BackendV1`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.BackendV1 "(in Qiskit v1.2)"), [`BackendV2`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.BackendV2 "(in Qiskit v1.2)"), `None`]) – Instance of `Backend` class or backend string name. Note that passing a backend name is deprecated.
  *   **max\_time** (`Union`\[`int`, `str`, `None`]) – Maximum amount of time a runtime session can be open before being forcibly closed. Can be specified as seconds (int) or a string like “2h 30m 40s”. This value must be less than the [system imposed maximum](/guides/max-execution-time).

  **Raises**

  **ValueError** – If an input value is invalid.
