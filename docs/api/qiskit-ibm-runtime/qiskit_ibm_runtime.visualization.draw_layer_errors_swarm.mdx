<Function id="qiskit_ibm_runtime.visualization.draw_layer_errors_swarm" isDedicatedPage={true} github="https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-runtime/tree/stable/0.34/qiskit_ibm_runtime/visualization/draw_layer_error.py#L267-L421" signature="draw_layer_errors_swarm(layer_errors, num_bodies=None, max_rate=None, min_rate=None, connected=None, colors=None, num_bins=None, opacities=0.4, names=None, x_coo=None, marker_size=None, height=500, width=800)">
  Draw a swarm plot for the given list of layer errors.

  This function plots the rates of each of the given layer errors along a vertical axes, offsetting the rates along the `x` axis to minimize the overlap between the markers. It helps visualizing the distribution of errors for different layer errors, as well as to track (using the `connected` argument) the evolution of specific generators across different layers.

  <Admonition title="Note" type="note">
    To calculate the offsets, this arranges the rates in `num_bins` equally-spaced bins, and then it assigns the `x` coordinates so that all the rates in the same bins are spaced around the vertical axis. Thus, a higher value of `num_bins` will result in higher overlaps between the markers.

  **Parameters**

  *   **layer\_errors** (*list\[*[*LayerError*](qiskit_ibm_runtime.utils.noise_learner_result.LayerError "qiskit_ibm_runtime.utils.noise_learner_result.LayerError")*]*) – The layer errors to draw.
  *   **num\_bodies** (*Optional\[int]*) – The weight of the generators to include in the plot, or `None` if all the generators should be included.
  *   **max\_rate** (*Optional\[float]*) – The largest rate to include in the plot, or `None` if no upper limit should be set.
  *   **min\_rate** (*Optional\[float]*) – The smallest rate to include in the plot, or `None` if no lower limit should be set.
  *   **connected** (*Optional\[list\[Union\[Pauli, str]]]*) – A list of generators whose markers are to be connected by lines.
  *   **colors** (*Optional\[list\[str]]*) – A list of colors for the markers in the plot, or `None` if these colors are to be chosen automatically.
  *   **num\_bins** (*Optional\[int]*) – The number of bins to place the rates into when calculating the `x`-axis offsets.
  *   **opacities** (*Union\[float, list\[float]]*) – A list of opacities for the markers.
  *   **names** (*Optional\[list\[str]]*) – The names of the various layers as displayed in the legend. If `None`, default names are assigned based on the layers’ position inside the `layer_errors` list.
  *   **x\_coo** (*Optional\[list\[float]]*) – The `x`-axis coordinates of the vertical axes that the markers are drawn around, or `None` if these axes should be placed at regular intervals.
  *   **marker\_size** (*Optional\[float]*) – The size of the marker in the plot.
  *   **height** (*int*) – The height of the returned figure.
  *   **width** (*int*) – The width of the returned figure.

  **Raises**

  *   **ValueError** – If an invalid grouping option is given.
  *   **ValueError** – If `colors` is given but its length is incorrect.

  **Return type**
