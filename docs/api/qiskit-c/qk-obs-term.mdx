# QkObsTerm

This is a group of functions for interacting with an opaque (Rust-space) SparseTerm instance.

### QkObsTerm

<Class id="QkObsTerm" signature="struct QkObsTerm">
  A term in a \[SparseObservable].

  This contains the coefficient (`coeff`), the number of qubits of the observable (`num_qubits`) and pointers to the `bit_terms` and `indices` arrays, which have length `len`. It’s the responsibility of the user that the data is coherent, see also the below section on safety.

  **Safety**

  *   `bit_terms` must be a non-null, aligned pointer to `len` elements of type `BitTerm`.
  *   `indices` must be a non-null, aligned pointer to `len` elements of type `uint32_t`.
</Class>

## Functions

### qk\_obsterm\_str

<Function id="qk_obsterm_str" signature="char *qk_obsterm_str(const QkObsTerm *term)">
  Return a string representation of the sparse term.

  **Example**

  ```c
  QkObs *obs = qk_obs_identity(100);
  QkObsTerm term;
  qk_obs_term(obs, 0, &term);
  char *string = qk_obsterm_str(&term);
  qk_str_free(string);
  ```

  **Safety**

  Behavior is undefined `term` is not a valid, non-null pointer to a `QkObsTerm`.

  The string must not be freed with the normal C free, you must use `qk_str_free` to free the memory consumed by the String. Not calling `qk_str_free` will lead to a memory leak.

  Do not change the length of the string after it’s returned, although values can be mutated.

  **Parameters**

  **term** – A pointer to the term.

  **Returns**

  The function exit code. This is `>0` if reading the term failed.
