# QkObsTerm

This is a group of functions for interacting with an opaque (Rust-space) SparseTerm instance.

## Data types

**<span id="structQkObsTerm" />struct QkObsTerm**

A term in a `QkObs`.

This contains the coefficient (`coeff`), the number of qubits of the observable (`num_qubits`) and pointers to the `bit_terms` and `indices` arrays, which have length `len`. It’s the responsibility of the user that the data is coherent, see also the below section on safety.

<span id="structQkObsTerm_1autotoc_md2" />

### Safety

<span id="structQkObsTerm_1autotoc_md2" />

*   `bit_terms` must be a non-null, aligned pointer to `len` elements of type `QkBitTerm`.
*   `indices` must be a non-null, aligned pointer to `len` elements of type `uint32_t`.

**<span id="structQkObsTerm_1af1019513a1a00f578d33b38d10b36670" />[QkComplex64](qk-complex-64#c.QkComplex64 "QkComplex64") coeff**

The coefficient of the observable term.

**<span id="structQkObsTerm_1a780a5ce2fdf4087abc63756254a40424" />size\_t len**

Length of the `bit_terms` and `indices` arrays.

**<span id="structQkObsTerm_1af131526e747cdcac7ecc1dffc66b439c" />QkBitTerm \*bit\_terms**

A non-null, aligned pointer to `len` elements of type `QkBitTerm`.

**<span id="structQkObsTerm_1a3e532a189705a89456f2d2b96d2ff759" />uint32\_t \*indices**

A non-null, aligned pointer to `len` elements of type `uint32_t`.

**<span id="structQkObsTerm_1aaab7bf8363689e37e5c9a8131c54f674" />uint32\_t num\_qubits**

The number of qubits the observable term is defined on.

## Functions

**<span id="group__QkObsTerm_1ga45426b47c2fb82c7296a353a57933724" />char \*qk\_obsterm\_str(const [QkObsTerm](#c.QkObsTerm "QkObsTerm") \*term)**

Return a string representation of the sparse term.

<span id="group__QkObsTerm_1autotoc_md91" />

### Example

```c
QkObs *obs = qk_obs_identity(100);
QkObsTerm term;
qk_obs_term(obs, 0, &term);
char *string = qk_obsterm_str(&term);
qk_str_free(string);
```

<span id="group__QkObsTerm_1autotoc_md92" />

### Safety

<span id="group__QkObsTerm_1autotoc_md92" />

Behavior is undefined `term` is not a valid, non-null pointer to a `QkObsTerm`.

The string must not be freed with the normal C free, you must use `qk_str_free` to free the memory consumed by the String. Not calling `qk_str_free` will lead to a memory leak.

Do not change the length of the string after it’s returned, although values can be mutated.

**Parameters**

*   **term** – A pointer to the term.

**Returns**

The function exit code. This is `>0` if reading the term failed.
