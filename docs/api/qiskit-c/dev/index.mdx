# Qiskit C API (`qiskit.h`)

The Qiskit C API is a low level interface to the core data model of Qiskit. It is designed to provide a high performance interface to Qiskit for compiled languages and provides a defined ABI to the internal Rust data model that is used to create the Python API. There are two expected modes of operation for the C API:

*   A standalone shared library for creating and working with Qiskit objects from compiled languages without a runtime dependency on Python, and
*   For building Python extensions that are using Qiskit but interface directly with the Rust objects from the extension code without using Python for better performance.

To get started, see [Install the Qiskit C API](/docs/guides/install-c-api). To combine the C API with custom Python extensions, see [Extend Qiskit in Python with C](/docs/guides/c-extension-for-python).

As this interface is still new in Qiskit it should be considered experimental and the interface might change between minor version releases.

## Transpiler

Using the transpiler from the C API is intended to only cover circuits created solely via the C API. If you are in a hybrid mode where youâ€™re using the C API with Python you should invoke the transpiler via the Python [`qiskit.transpiler`](/docs/api/qiskit/dev/transpiler#module-qiskit.transpiler "qiskit.transpiler") module instead; the functionality is the same Rust internals they just offer different entrypoints. The C API for transpilation makes assumptions about the input only using constructs exposed to the C Quantum Circuit API and you will potentially get incomplete results transpiling circuits from Python via the C API.
