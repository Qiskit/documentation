# Versioning

Qiskitâ€™s version can be queried using a set of compiler macros.

**QISKIT\_VERSION**

A human-readable version as `char*`. For example: `"2.1.0rc1"`.

**QISKIT\_VERSION\_HEX**

The version number as 4-byte hexadecimal. The format is `0xMMmmppls`, where `M` is the major, `m` is the minor, `p` is the patch, `l` is the release level and `s` is the serial. For example, 2.1.0rc1 is `0x020100C1`.

**QISKIT\_VERSION\_MAJOR**

The major release version.

**QISKIT\_VERSION\_MINOR**

The minor release version.

**QISKIT\_VERSION\_PATCH**

The patch release version.

**QISKIT\_RELEASE\_LEVEL**

The release level: `0xA` for the unreleased dev (or alpha) version, `0xC` for the release candidate, and `0xF` for the stable (or final) version.

**QISKIT\_RELEASE\_SERIAL**

This can be used to indicate the pre-release number in a pre-release series. For example, this would be set to `1` for `2.1.0rc1`. This is `0` for the final version.

**QISKIT\_GET\_VERSION\_HEX(major, minor, patch, level, serial)**

A macro to pack the version numbers into hexadecimal format. This can be used as tool to compare numbers, for example to ensure the current version is at least the stable 2.1.0 release do:

```c
if (QISKIT_VERSION_HEX >= QISKIT_GET_VERSION_HEX(2, 1, 0, 0xF, 0)) {
    // Code for version 2.1.0 (final) or later
}
```
