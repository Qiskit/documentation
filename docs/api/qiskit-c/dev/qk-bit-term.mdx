# QkBitTerm

```c
enum QkBitTerm
```

An enum that to represent each of the single-qubit alphabet terms enumerated below.

## Values

*   **`QkBitTerm_X`**

    The Pauli $X$ operator.

    Value: 2 (`0b0010`)

*   **`QkBitTerm_Y`**

    The Pauli $Y$ operator.

    Value: 3 (`0b0011`)

*   **`QkBitTerm_Z`**

    The Pauli $Z$ operator.

    Value: 1 (`0b0001`)

*   **`QkBitTerm_Plus`**

    The projector $\lvert +\rangle\langle +\rvert$ to the positive $X$ eigenstate.

    Value: 10 (`0b1010`)

*   **`QkBitTerm_Minus`**

    The projector $\lvert -\rangle\langle -\rvert$ to the negative $X$ eigenstate.

    Value: 6 (`0b0110`)

*   **`QkBitTerm_Right`**

    The projector $\lvert r\rangle\langle r\rvert$ to the positive $Y$ eigenstate.

    Value: 11 (`0b1011`)

*   **`QkBitTerm_Left`**

    The projector $\lvert l\rangle\langle l\rvert$ to the negative $Y$ eigenstate.

    Value: 7 (`0b1011`)

*   **`QkBitTerm_Zero`**

    The projector $\lvert 0\rangle\langle 0\rvert$ to the positive $Z$ eigenstate.

    Value: 9 (`0b1001`)

*   **`QkBitTerm_One`**

    The projector $\lvert 1\rangle\langle 1\rvert$ to the negative $Z$ eigenstate.

    Value: 5 (`0b0101`)

## Representation

The enum is stored as single byte, its elements are represented as unsigned 8-bit integer.

```c
typedef uint8_t QkBitTerm
```

<Admonition title="Warning" type="caution">
  Not all `uint8_t` values are valid bit terms. Passing invalid values is undefined behavior.
</Admonition>

The numeric structure of these is that they are all four-bit values of which the low two bits are the (phase-less) symplectic representation of the Pauli operator related to the object, where the low bit denotes a contribution by $Z$ and the second lowest a contribution by $X$, while the upper two bits are `00` for a Pauli operator, `01` for the negative-eigenstate projector, and `10` for the positive-eigenstate projector.

## Functions

### qk\_bitterm\_label

<Function id="qk_bitterm_label" signature="uint8_t qk_bitterm_label(QkBitTerm bit_term)">
  Get the label for a bit term.

  <span id="group__QkBitTerm_1autotoc_md71" />

  #### Example

  ```c
  QkBitTerm bit_term = QkBitTerm_Y;
  // cast the uint8_t to char
  char label = qk_bitterm_label(bit_term);
  ```

  <span id="group__QkBitTerm_1autotoc_md72" />

  #### Safety

  <span id="group__QkBitTerm_1autotoc_md72" />

  The behavior is undefined if `bit_term` is not a valid `uint8_t` value of a `QkBitTerm`.

  **Parameters**

  **bit\_term** â€“ The bit term.

  **Returns**

  The label as `uint8_t`, which can be cast to `char` to obtain the character.
