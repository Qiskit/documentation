# QkSabreLayoutOptions

When running the `qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_sabre_layout` function this type defines the options for running the pass.

## Data Types

### QkSabreLayoutOptions

<Class id="QkSabreLayoutOptions" signature="struct QkSabreLayoutOptions">
  The options for running `qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_sabre_layout`. This struct is used as an input to control the behavior of the layout and routing algorithms.

  #### uintptr\_t max\_iterations

  <Attribute id="max_iterations">
    The number of forward-backward iterations in the sabre routing algorithm
  </Attribute>

  #### uintptr\_t num\_swap\_trials

  <Attribute id="num_swap_trials">
    The number of trials to run of the sabre routing algorithm for each iteration. When > 1 the trial that routing trial that results in the output with the fewest swap gates will be selected.
  </Attribute>

  #### uintptr\_t num\_random\_trials

  <Attribute id="num_random_trials">
    The number of random layout trials to run. The trial that results in the output with the fewest swap gates will be selected.
  </Attribute>

  #### uint64\_t seed

  <Attribute id="seed">
    A seed value for the pRNG used internally.
  </Attribute>
</Class>

## Functions

### qk\_sabre\_layout\_options\_default

<Function id="qk_sabre_layout_options_default" signature="QkSabreLayoutOptions qk_sabre_layout_options_default(void)">
  Build a default sabre layout options object. This builds a sabre layout with `max_iterations` set to 4, both `num_swap_trials` and `num_random_trials` set to 20, and the seed selected by a RNG seeded from system entropy.
</Function>
