# QkObs

```c
typedef struct QkObs QkObs
```

An observable over Pauli bases that stores its data in a qubit-sparse format.

## Mathematics

This observable represents a sum over strings of the Pauli operators and Pauli-eigenstate projectors, with each term weighted by some complex number. That is, the full observable is

$$
\text{\texttt{QkObs}} = \sum_i c_i \bigotimes_n A^{(n)}_i


$$

for complex numbers $c_i$ and single-qubit operators acting on qubit $n$ from a restricted alphabet $A^{(n)}_i$. The sum over $i$ is the sum of the individual terms, and the tensor product produces the operator strings. The alphabet of allowed single-qubit operators that the $A^{(n)}_i$ are drawn from is the Pauli operators and the Pauli-eigenstate projection operators. Explicitly, these are:

<span id="qkobs-alphabet" />

| Operator                                                                 | `QkBitTerm`       | Numeric value |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------- |
| $I$ (identity)                                                           | Not stored.       | Not stored.   |
| $X$ (Pauli X)                                                            | `QkBitTerm_X`     | `0b0010` (2)  |
| $Y$ (Pauli Y)                                                            | `QkBitTerm_Y`     | `0b0011` (3)  |
| $Z$ (Pauli Z)                                                            | `QkBitTerm_Z`     | `0b0001` (1)  |
| $\lvert+\rangle\langle+\rvert$ (projector to positive eigenstate of X)   | `QkBitTerm_Plus`  | `0b1010` (10) |
| $\lvert-\rangle\langle-\rvert$ (projector to negative eigenstate of X)   | `QkBitTerm_Minus` | `0b0110` (6)  |
| $\lvert r\rangle\langle r\rvert$ (projector to positive eigenstate of Y) | `QkBitTerm_Right` | `0b1011` (11) |
| $\lvert l\rangle\langle l\rvert$ (projector to negative eigenstate of Y) | `QkBitTerm_Left`  | `0b0111` (7)  |
| $\lvert0\rangle\langle0\rvert$ (projector to positive eigenstate of Z)   | `QkBitTerm_Zero`  | `0b1001` (9)  |
| $\lvert1\rangle\langle1\rvert$ (projector to negative eigenstate of Z)   | `QkBitTerm_One`   | `0b0101` (5)  |

Due to allowing both the Paulis and their projectors, the allowed alphabet forms an overcomplete basis of the operator space. This means that there is not a unique summation to represent a given observable. As a consequence, comparison requires additional care and using `qk_obs_canonicalize` on two mathematically equivalent observables might not result in the same representation.

`QkObs` uses its particular overcomplete basis with the aim of making “efficiency of measurement” equivalent to “efficiency of representation”. For example, the observable ${\lvert0\rangle\langle0\rvert}^{\otimes n}$ can be efficiently measured on hardware with simple $Z$ measurements, but can only be represented in terms of Paulis as ${(I + Z)}^{\otimes n}/2^n$, which requires $2^n$ stored terms. `QkObs` requires only a single term to store this. The downside to this is that it is impractical to take an arbitrary matrix and find the *best* `QkObs` representation. You typically will want to construct a `QkObs` directly, rather than trying to decompose into one.

## Representation

The internal representation of a `QkObs` stores only the non-identity qubit operators. This makes it significantly more efficient to represent observables such as $\sum_{n\in \text{qubits}} Z^{(n)}$; `QkObs` requires an amount of memory linear in the total number of qubits. The terms are stored compressed, similar in spirit to the compressed sparse row format of sparse matrices. In this analogy, the terms of the sum are the “rows”, and the qubit terms are the “columns”, where an absent entry represents the identity rather than a zero. More explicitly, the representation is made up of four contiguous arrays:

| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `qk_obs_coeffs`         | $t$    | The complex scalar multiplier for each term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `qk_obs_bit_terms`      | $s$    | Each of the non-identity single-qubit terms for all of the operators, in order. These correspond to the non-identity $A^{(n)}_i$ in the sum description, where the entries are stored in order of increasing $i$ first, and in order of increasing $n$ within each term.                                                                                                                   |
| `qk_obs_indices`        | $s$    | The corresponding qubit ($n$) for each of the bit terms. `QkObs` requires that this list is term-wise sorted, and algorithms can rely on this invariant being upheld.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `qk_obs_boundaries`     | $t+1$  | The indices that partition the bit terms and indices into complete terms. For term number $i$, its complex coefficient is stored at index `i`, and its non-identity single-qubit operators and their corresponding qubits are in the range `[boundaries[i], boundaries[i+1])` in the bit terms and indices, respectively. The boundaries always have an explicit 0 as their first element. |

The length parameter $t$ is the number of terms in the sum and can be queried using `qk_obs_num_terms`. The parameter $s$ is the total number of non-identity single-qubit terms and can be queried using `qk_obs_len`.

As illustrative examples:

*   in the case of a zero operator, the boundaries are length 1 (a single 0) and all other vectors are empty.
*   in the case of a fully simplified identity operator, the boundaries are `{0, 0}`, the coefficients have a single entry, and both the bit terms and indices are empty.
*   for the operator $Z_2 Z_0 - X_3 Y_1$, the boundaries are `{0, 2, 4}`, the coeffs are `{1.0, -1.0}`, the bit terms are `{QkBitTerm_Z, QkBitTerm_Z, QkBitTerm_Y, QkBitTerm_X}` and the indices are `{0, 2, 1, 3}`. The operator might act on more than four qubits, depending on the the number of qubits (see `qk_obs_num_qubits`). Note that the single-bit terms and indices are sorted into termwise sorted order.

These cases are not special, they’re fully consistent with the rules and should not need special handling.

### Canonical ordering

For any given mathematical observable, there are several ways of representing it with `QkObs`. For example, the same set of single-bit terms and their corresponding indices might appear multiple times in the observable. Mathematically, this is equivalent to having only a single term with all the coefficients summed. Similarly, the terms of the sum in a `QkObs` can be in any order while representing the same observable, since addition is commutative (although while floating-point addition is not associative, `QkObs` makes no guarantees about the summation order).

These two categories of representation degeneracy can cause the operator equality, `qk_obs_equal`, to claim that two observables are not equal, despite representating the same object. In these cases, it can be convenient to define some *canonical form*, which allows observables to be compared structurally. You can put a `QkObs` in canonical form by using the `qk_obs_canonicalize` function. The precise ordering of terms in canonical ordering is not specified, and may change between versions of Qiskit. Within the same version of Qiskit, however, you can compare two observables structurally by comparing their simplified forms.

<Admonition title="Note" type="note">
  If you wish to account for floating-point tolerance in the comparison, it is safest to use a recipe such as:

  ```c
  bool equivalent(QkObs *left, QkObs *right, double tol) {
      // compare a canonicalized version of left - right to the zero observable
      QkObs *neg_right = qk_obs_mul(right, -1);
      QkObs *diff = qk_obs_add(left, neg_right);
      QkObs *canonical = qk_obs_canonicalize(diff, tol);

      QkObs *zero = qk_obs_zero(qk_obs_num_qubits(left));
      bool equiv = qk_obs_equal(diff, zero);
      // free all temporary variables
      qk_obs_free(neg_right);
      qk_obs_free(diff);
      qk_obs_free(canonical);
      qk_obs_free(zero);
      return equiv;
  }
  ```
</Admonition>

<Admonition title="Note" type="note">
  The canonical form produced by `qk_obs_canonicalize` alone will not universally detect all observables that are equivalent due to the over-complete basis alphabet.
</Admonition>

### Indexing

Individual observable sum terms in `QkObs` can be accessed via `qk_obs_term` and return objects of type `QkObsTerm`. These terms then contain fields with the coefficient of the term, its bit terms, indices and the number of qubits it is defined on. Together with the information of the number of terms, you can iterate over all observable terms as

```c
size_t num_terms = qk_obs_num_terms(obs);  // obs is QkObs*
for (size_t i = 0; i < num_terms; i++) {
    QkObsTerm term;  // allocate term on stack
    int exit = qk_obs_term(obs, i, &term);  // get the term (exit > 0 upon index errors)
    // do something with the term...
}
```

<Admonition title="Warning" type="caution">
  Populating a `QkObsTerm` via `qk_obs_term` will reference data of the original `QkObs`. Modifying the bit terms or indices will change the observable and can leave it in an incoherent state.
</Admonition>

## Construction

`QkObs` can be constructed by initializing an empty observable (with `qk_obs_zero`) and iteratively adding terms (with `qk_obs_add_term`). Alternatively, an observable can be constructed from “raw” data (with `qk_obs_new`) if all internal data is specified. This requires care to ensure the data is coherent and results in a valid observable.
