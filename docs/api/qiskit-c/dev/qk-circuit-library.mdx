# Cirucit Library

The Qiskit circuit library contains functions for building commonly used quantum circuits.

## Functions

### qk\_circuit\_library\_quantum\_volume

<Function id="qk_circuit_library_quantum_volume" signature="QkCircuit *qk_circuit_library_quantum_volume(uint32_t num_qubits, size_t depth, int64_t seed)">
  Generate a Quantum Volume model circuit

  The model circuits are random instances of circuits used to measure the Quantum Volume metric, as introduced in \[1]. The model circuits consist of layers of Haar random elements of SU(4) applied between corresponding pairs of qubits in a random bipartition.

  This function is multithreaded and will launch a thread pool with threads equal to the number of CPUs by default. You can tune the number of threads with the RAYON\_NUM\_THREADS environment variable. For example, setting RAYON\_NUM\_THREADS=4 would limit the thread pool to 4 threads.

  #### Parameters

  <span id="group__QkCircuitLibrary_1autotoc_md48" />

  *   `num_qubits`: The number qubits to use for the generated circuit.
  *   `depth`: The number of layers for the generated circuit.
  *   `seed`: An RNG seed used for generating the random SU(4) matrices used in the output circuit. If the provided number is negative the seed used will be soured from system entropy.
