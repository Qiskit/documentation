# Transpiler Passes

Transpilation is the process of rewriting a given input circuit to match the topology of a specific quantum device, and/or to optimize the circuit for execution on a quantum system.

Most circuits must undergo a series of transformations that make them compatible with a given target device, and optimize them to reduce the effects of noise on the resulting outcomes. Rewriting quantum circuits to match hardware constraints and optimizing for performance can be far from trivial. The flow of logic in the rewriting tool chain need not be linear, and can often have iterative sub-loops, conditional branches, and other complex behaviors.

In Qiskit, the transpiler is built up by executing as a series of passes that each perform a singular task to analyze or transform a quantum circuit. The Python [`transpiler`](/docs/api/qiskit/dev/transpiler#module-qiskit.transpiler "qiskit.transpiler") documentation contains a more detailed explanation of the transpilation process.

The Qiskit C API provides functions that execute transpiler passes in a standalone mode, where you provide the pass with a `QkCircuit` and then any necessary configuration for the execution of the pass, typically at least a `QkTarget`. These functions return either a new `QkCircuit` pointer or the analysis results of running the pass. While this can be used to create a custom workflow, the functions following the naming convention `qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_*` will have higher overhead as internally they’re converting from the quantum circuit to the dag circuit IR on the input, and if the function returns a new circuit it will convert back before returning. These standalone functions are intended to execute single passes in isolation rather than building a custom transpilation pipeline.

## Functions

### qk\_transpiler\_pass\_standalone\_vf2\_layout

<Function id="qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_vf2_layout" signature="QkVF2LayoutResult *qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_vf2_layout(const QkCircuit *circuit, const QkTarget *target, bool strict_direction, int64_t call_limit, double time_limit, intptr_t max_trials)">
  Run the VF2Layout pass on a circuit.

  VF2Layout is a pass for choosing a layout of a circuit onto a connectivity graph as a subgraph isomorphism problem solved by VF2.

  If this pass finds a solution that means there is a “perfect layout” and that no further swap mapping or routing is needed. However, there is not always a possible solution, or a solution might exist but it is not found within the limits specified when the pass is called.

  By default, this pass will construct a heuristic scoring map based on the error rates in the provided `target` argument. The function will continue searching for layouts and use the heuristic scoring to return the layout which will run with the best estimated fidelity.

  #### Example

  ```c
  QkTarget *target = qk_target_new(5)
  QkTargetEntry *cx_entry = qk_target_entry_new(QkGate_CX);
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < current_num_qubits - 1; i++) {
      uint32_t qargs[2] = {i, i + 1};
      double inst_error = 0.0090393 * (current_num_qubits - i);
      double inst_duration = 0.020039;
      qk_target_entry_add_property(cx_entry, qargs, 2, inst_duration, inst_error);
  }
  QkExitCode result_cx = qk_target_add_instruction(target, cx_entry);
  QkCircuit *qc = qk_circuit_new(4, 0);
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < qk_circuit_num_qubits(qc) - 1; i++) {
      uint32_t qargs[2] = {i, i + 1};
      for (uint32_t j = 0; j<i+1; j++) {
          qk_circuit_gate(qc, QkGate_CX, qargs, NULL);
      }
  }
  QkVF2LayoutResult *layout_result = qk_transpiler_pass_standalone_vf2_layout(qc, target, false, -1, NAN, -1);
  qk_vf2_layout_result_free(layout_result);
  ```

  #### Safety

  <span id="group__QkTranspilerPasses_1autotoc_md100" />

  Behavior is undefined if `circuit` or `target` is not a valid, non-null pointer to a `QkCircuit` and `QkTarget`.

  **Parameters**

  *   **circuit** – A pointer to the circuit to run VF2Layout on
  *   **target** – A pointer to the target to run the VF2Layout pass on
  *   **strict\_direction** – If true the pass will consider the edge direction in the connectivity described in the `target`. Typically setting this to `false` is desireable as an undirected search has more degrees of freedom and is more likely to find a layout (or a better layout if there are multiple choices) and correcting directionality is a simple operation for later transpilation stages.
  *   **call\_limit** – The number of state visits to attempt in each execution of the VF2 algorithm. If the value is set to a negative value the VF2 algorithm will run without any limit.
  *   **time\_limit** – The total time in seconds to run for `VF2Layout`. This is checked after each layout search so it is not a hard time limit, but a soft limit that when checked if the set time has elapsed the function will return the best layout it has found so far. Set this to a value less than or equal to 0.0 to run without any time limit.
  *   **max\_trials** – The maximum number of trials to run the VF2 algorithm to try and find layouts. If the value is negative this will be treated as unbounded which means the algorithm will run until all possible layouts are scored. If the value is 0 the number of trials will be limited based on the number of edges in the interaction or the coupling graph (whichever is larger).

  **Returns**

  QkVF2LayoutResult A pointer to a result object that contains the results of the pass. This object is heap allocated and will need to be freed with the `qk_vf2_layout_result_free()` function.
