# QkBitTerm

This is a group of functions for interacting with an opaque (Rust-space) BitTerm instance.

### QkBitTerm

<Class id="QkBitTerm" signature="typedef uint8_t QkBitTerm" />

## Functions

### qk\_bitterm\_label

<Function id="qk_bitterm_label" signature="uint8_t qk_bitterm_label(QkBitTerm bit_term)">
  Get the label for a bit term.

  **Example**

  ```c
  QkBitTerm bit_term = QkBitTerm_Y;
  // cast the uint8_t to char
  char label = qk_bitterm_label(bit_term);
  ```

  **Safety**

  The behavior is undefined if `bit_term` is not a valid `uint8_t` value of a \[BitTerm].

  **Parameters**

  **bit\_term** – The bit term.

  **Returns**

  The label as `uint8_t`, which can be cast to `char` to obtain the character.
