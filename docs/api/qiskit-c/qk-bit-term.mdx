# QkBitTerm

This is a group of functions for interacting with an opaque (Rust-space) BitTerm instance.

## Data types

### QkBitTerm

<Class id="QkBitTerm" signature="enum QkBitTerm">
  Named handle to the alphabet of single-qubit terms.

  This is just the Rust-space representation. We make a separate Python-space `enum.IntEnum` to represent the same information, since we enforce strongly typed interactions in Rust, including not allowing the stored values to be outside the valid `BitTerm`s, but doing so in Python would make it very difficult to use the class efficiently with Numpy array views. We attach this sister class of `BitTerm` to `SparseObservable` as a scoped class.

  #### Representation

  <span id="qiskit_8h_1autotoc_md0" />

  The `u8` representation and the exact numerical values of these are part of the public API. The low two bits are the symplectic Pauli representation of the required measurement basis with Z in the Lsb0 and X in the Lsb1 (e.g. X and its eigenstate projectors all have their two low bits as `0b10`). The high two bits are `00` for the operator, `10` for the projector to the positive eigenstate, and `01` for the projector to the negative eigenstate.

  The `0b00_00` representation thus ends up being the natural representation of the `I` operator, but this is never stored, and is not named in the enumeration.

  This operator does not store phase terms of \$-i\$. `BitTerm::Y` has `(1, 1)` as its `(z, x)` representation, and represents exactly the Pauli Y operator; any additional phase is stored only in a corresponding coefficient.

  #### Dev notes

  <span id="qiskit_8h_1autotoc_md1" />

  This type is required to be `u8`, but it’s a subtype of `u8` because not all `u8` are valid `BitTerm`s. For interop with Python space, we accept Numpy arrays of `u8` to represent this, which we transmute into slices of `BitTerm`, after checking that all the values are correct (or skipping the check if Python space promises that it upheld the checks).

  We deliberately *don’t* impl `numpy::Element` for `BitTerm` (which would let us accept and return `PyArray1<BitTerm>` at Python-space boundaries) so that it’s clear when we’re doing the transmute, and we have to be explicit about the safety of that.

  *Values:*

    Projector to the positive eigenstate of Pauli X.
  </Attribute>

  #### enumerator QkBitTerm\_Minus

  <Attribute id="QkBitTerm_Minus">
    Projector to the negative eigenstate of Pauli X.
  </Attribute>

  #### enumerator QkBitTerm\_Y

  <Attribute id="QkBitTerm_Y">
    Pauli Y operator.
  </Attribute>

  #### enumerator QkBitTerm\_Right

  <Attribute id="QkBitTerm_Right">
    Projector to the positive eigenstate of Pauli Y.
  </Attribute>

  #### enumerator QkBitTerm\_Left

  <Attribute id="QkBitTerm_Left">
    Projector to the negative eigenstate of Pauli Y.
  </Attribute>

  #### enumerator QkBitTerm\_Z

  <Attribute id="QkBitTerm_Z">
    Pauli Z operator.
  </Attribute>

  #### enumerator QkBitTerm\_Zero

  <Attribute id="QkBitTerm_Zero">
    Projector to the positive eigenstate of Pauli Z.

## Functions

### qk\_bitterm\_label

<Function id="qk_bitterm_label" signature="uint8_t qk_bitterm_label(QkBitTerm bit_term)">
  Get the label for a bit term.

  <span id="group___qk_bit_term_1autotoc_md46" />

  #### Example

  ```c
  QkBitTerm bit_term = QkBitTerm_Y;
  // cast the uint8_t to char
  char label = qk_bitterm_label(bit_term);
  ```

  <span id="group___qk_bit_term_1autotoc_md47" />

  #### Safety

  <span id="group___qk_bit_term_1autotoc_md47" />

  The behavior is undefined if `bit_term` is not a valid `uint8_t` value of a \[BitTerm].

  **Parameters**

  **bit\_term** – The bit term.

  **Returns**

  The label as `uint8_t`, which can be cast to `char` to obtain the character.
