# Responsible quantum computing

Quantum technology has the potential to accelerate use cases and even solve problems that were previously inaccessible. But how will this new computing power impact society at large? This requires us to be thoughtful — we must research and develop responsibly. 

Our mission statement at IBM&reg; is to be “the catalyst to make the world work better,” and IBM Quantum&trade; runs a Responsible Quantum Initiative to ensure that our development is in line with that mission. 

We define Responsible Quantum Computing as quantum computing that’s aware of its effects. As part of this effort, we crafted five Responsible Quantum Principles for developing and deploying quantum technology that our team follows internally. 

### Make a positive societal impact

We are developing a new form of technology. We are doing so because IBM is the catalyst to make the world work better. Therefore, quantum computing, too, should make the world work better by prioritizing use cases that make a positive societal impact.

### Explore use cases with foresight

Developing a new technology means we may unlock use cases or algorithms that never existed before. We must be prepared for unintended impacts to use cases that seem positive.

### Promote our products accurately

As innovators, it is our responsibility to ensure that the world is aware of quantum’s promise, its limitations, and the expected development timeline.

### Make consistent principled decisions

It is the responsibility of IBM Quantum employees and IBM Quantum leadership alike to uphold these principles. Where decisions come in conflict with these principles, it is the responsibility of leadership to make decisions consistently.

### Build a diverse and inclusive quantum community

IBM Quantum is building a global quantum computing ecosystem. It is our responsibility to create an ecosystem that represents the diversity of the world at large, and be inclusive of people of all backgrounds, experiences, and abilities.

Please take note of three sections in the [IBM Quantum End User Agreement](https://quantum.ibm.com/terms) that describe acceptable and responsible uses of IBM Quantum technology and services. 

> **9.b** *IBM Quantum may not be used for unlawful, obscene, offensive or fraudulent activity, such as advocating or causing harm, interfering with or violating the integrity or security of a network or system, evading filters, sending unsolicited, abusive, deceptive or disparaging messages, viruses or harmful code, violating third party rights, for the research, design, development, production, maintenance, repair, overhaul, or use of any offensive or defensive weapons of any kind, for attempting to defeat encryption, or for processing regulated data including personal information, financial data and health data. In addition, IBM may remove or refuse to accept or use any Content without limitation.*
>
> **9.c** *You may not reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover or decode any hardware component of IBM Quantum.*
>
> **9.d** *You may not use IBM Quantum in any application or situation where failure could lead to death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to severe physical or environmental damage, such as aircraft, motor vehicles or mass transport, nuclear or chemical facilities, life support or medical equipment, or weaponry systems.*

Finally, as part of our responsible quantum effort, we are committed to fostering a welcoming community of users, both online and at in-person engagements. Please familiarize yourself with the [Qiskit Code of Conduct](/open-source/code-of-conduct) and its [enforcement procedures](/open-source/code-of-conduct#responsibilities-enforcement).
