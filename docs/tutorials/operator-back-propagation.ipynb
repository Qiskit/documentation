    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator backpropagation is a technique which involves absorbing operations from the end of a quantum circuit into the measured observable, generally reducing the depth of the circuit at the cost of additional terms in the observable. The goal is to backpropagate as much of the circuit as possible without allowing the observable to grow too large. A Qiskit-based implementation is available in the OBP Qiskit addon, more details can be found in the corresponding [docs](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-obp) with a [simple example](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-obp-get-started) to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example circuit for which an observable $O = \\sum_P c_P P$ is to be measured, where $P$ are Paulis and $c_P$ are coefficients. Let us denote the circuit as a single unitary $U$ which can be logically partitioned into $U = U_C U_Q$ as shown in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Circuit diagram showing Uq followed by Uc](/docs/images/tutorials/improving-estimation-of-expectation-values-with-operator-backpropagation/logical-partitioning.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator backpropagation absorbs the unitary $U_C$ into the observable by evolving it as $O' = U_C^{\\dagger}OU_C = \\sum_P c_P U_C^{\\dagger}PU_C$. In other words, part of the computation is performed classically via the evolution of the observable from $O$ to $O'$. The original problem can now be reformulated as measuring the observable $O'$ for the new lower depth circuit whose unitary is $U_Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unitary $U_C$ is represented as a number of slices $U_C = U_S U_{S-1}...U_2U_1$. There are multiple ways for defining a slice. For instance, in the above example circuit, each layer of $R_{zz}$ and each layer of $R_x$ gates can be considered as an individual slice. Backpropagation involves calculation of $O' = \\Pi_{s=1}^S \\sum_P c_P U_s^{\\dagger} P U_s$ classically. Each slice $U_s$ can be represented as $U_s = exp(\\frac{-i\\theta_s P_s}{2})$, where $P_s$ is a $n$-qubit Pauli and $\\theta_s$ is a scalar. It is easy to verify that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_s^{\\dagger} P U_s = P \\qquad \\text{if} ~[P,P_s] = 0,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U_s^{\\dagger} P U_s = \\qquad cos(\\theta_s)P + i sin(\\theta_s)P_sP \\qquad \\text{if} ~\\{P,P_s\\} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, if $\\{P,P_s\\} = 0$, then we need to execute two quantum circuits, instead of one, to calculate the expectation value. Therefore, backpropagation may increase the number of terms in the observable, leading to higher number of circuit execution. One way to allow for deeper backpropagation into the circuit, while preventing the operator from growing too large, is to truncate terms with small coefficients, rather than adding them to the operator. For instance, in the above example, one may choose to truncate the term involving $P_sP$ provided that $\\theta_s$ is sufficiently small. Truncating terms can result in fewer quantum circuits to execute, but doing so results in some error in the final expectation value calculation proportional to the magnitude of the truncated terms' coefficients.\n",

    "\n",
    "During backpropagation, the number of terms in the operator will generally approach $4^N$ quickly, where $N$ is the number of qubits. When two terms in the operator do not commute qubit-wise, we need separate circuits to obtain the expectation values corresponding to them. For example, if we have a 2-qubit observable $O = 0.1 XX + 0.3 IZ - 0.5 IX$, then since $[XX,IX] = 0$, measurement in a single basis is sufficient to calculate the expectation values for these two terms. However, $IZ$ anti-commutes with the other two terms. So we need a separate basis measurement to calculate the expectation value of $IZ$. In other words, we need two, instead of one, circuit to calculate $\\langle O \\rangle$. As the number of terms in the operator increase, there is a possibility that the required number of circuit executions also increase.\n",
