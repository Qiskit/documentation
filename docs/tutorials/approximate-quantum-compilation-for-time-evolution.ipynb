    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to implement **Approximate Quantum Compilation** using tensor networks (AQC-Tensor) with Qiskit to enhance quantum circuit performance. We apply AQC-Tensor within the context of a Trotterized time evolution to reduce circuit depth while maintaining simulation accuracy, following the Qiskit framework for state preparation and optimization. In this notebook, you'll learn how to create a low-depth ansatz circuit from an initial Trotter circuit, optimize it with tensor networks, and prepare it for quantum hardware execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to simulate time evolution for a model Hamiltonian with a reduced circuit depth. This is achieved using the **AQC-Tensor** Qiskit addon, [qiskit-addon-aqc-tensor](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-aqc-tensor), which leverages tensor networks, specifically matrix product states (MPS), to compress and optimize the initial circuit. Through iterative adjustments, the compressed ansatz circuit maintains fidelity to the original circuit while staying feasible for near-term quantum hardware. More details can be found in the corresponding [docs](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-aqc) with a [simple example](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-aqc-get-started) to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximate Quantum Compilation is particularly advantageous in quantum simulations that exceed hardware coherence times, as it allows complex simulations to be performed more efficiently. This tutorial will guide you through the AQC-Tensor workflow setup in Qiskit, covering initialization of a Hamiltonian, generation of Trotter circuits, and transpilation of the final optimized circuit for a target device."

    "- **Initial Segment**: This initial portion of the evolution, from $ t_i = 0.0 $ to $ t_f = 0.2 $, is simulable with MPS and can be efficiently “compiled” using AQC-Tensor. By using the [AQC-Tensor Qiskit addon](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-aqc-tensor), we generate a compressed circuit for this segment, referred to as the `aqc_target_circuit`. Because this segment will be simulated on a tensor-network simulator, we can afford to use a higher number of Trotter layers without impacting hardware resources significantly. We set `aqc_target_num_trotter_steps = 32` for this segment.\n",

    "- **Subsequent Segment**: This remaining portion of the evolution, from $ t = 0.2 $ to $ t = 0.4 $, will be executed on quantum hardware, referred to as the `subsequent_circuit`. Given hardware limitations, we aim to use as few Trotter layers as possible to maintain a manageable circuit depth. For this segment, we use `subsequent_num_trotter_steps = 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Choose the split time\n",
    "We choose $t = 0.2$ as the split time to balance classical simulability with hardware feasibility. Early in the evolution, entanglement in the XXZ model remains low enough for classical methods like MPS to approximate accurately.\n",

We select a stopping criterion for the fidelity that ensures it surpasses the fidelity of the initial circuit without AQC-Tensor.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated how to use Approximate Quantum Compilation with tensor networks (AQC-Tensor) to compress and optimize circuits for simulating quantum dynamics at scale. Utilizing both small and large Heisenberg models, we applied AQC-Tensor to reduce the circuit depth required for Trotterized time evolution. By generating a parametrized ansatz from a simplified Trotter circuit and optimizing it with matrix product state (MPS) techniques, we achieved a low-depth approximation of the target evolution that is both accurate and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow here highlights the key advantages of AQC-Tensor for scaling quantum simulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significant circuit compression**: AQC-Tensor reduced the circuit depth needed for complex time evolution, enhancing its feasibility on current devices.\n",
    "- **Efficient optimization**: The MPS approach provided a robust framework for parameter optimization, balancing fidelity with computational efficiency.\n",
    "- **Hardware-ready execution**: Transpiling the final optimized circuit ensured it met the constraints of the target quantum hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "As larger quantum devices and more advanced algorithms emerge, techniques like AQC-Tensor will become essential for running complex quantum simulations on near-term hardware, demonstrating promising progress in managing depth and fidelity for scalable quantum applications."
