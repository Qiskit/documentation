    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Low-overhead error detection with spacetime codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15725) [[1]](#references) by Simon Martiel and Ali Javadi-Abhari proposes synthesizing low-weight, connectivity-aware spacetime checks for Clifford-dominated circuits, then post-selecting on those checks to catch faults with far less overhead than full error correction and fewer shots than standard error mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper proposes a novel method for error detection in quantum circuits (specifically Clifford circuits) that strikes a balance between full error correction and lighter-weight mitigation techniques. The key idea is to use spacetime codes to generate \"checks\" across the circuit that are capable of catching errors, with significantly lower qubit and gate overhead than full fault-tolerant error correction. The authors design efficient algorithms to select checks that are low-weight (involving few qubits), compatible with the physical connectivity of the device, and cover large temporal and spatial regions of the circuit. They demonstrate the approach on circuits with up to 50 logical qubits and ~2450 CZ gates, achieving physical-to-logical fidelity gains of up to 236x. Also note that as circuits include more non-Clifford operations, the number of valid checks shrinks exponentially, indicating the method works best for Clifford-dominated circuits. Overall, in the near term, error detection via spacetime codes may offer a practical, lower-overhead route to improving reliability in quantum hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "This error detection technique relies on the notion of coherent Pauli checks and is based on the work [Single-shot error mitigation by coherent Pauli checks](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.033193) [[2]](#references) by van den Berg et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recently, the paper [Big cats: entanglement in 120 qubits and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09520) [[3]](#references) by Javadi-Abhari et al., reports the creation of a 120-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, the largest multipartite entangled state achieved to date on a superconducting-qubit platform. Using a hardware-aware compiler, low-overhead error detection, and a \"temporary uncomputation\" technique to reduce noise, the researchers achieved a fidelity of 0.56 ± 0.03 with about 28% post-selection efficiency. The work demonstrates genuine entanglement across all 120 qubits, validating multiple fidelity-certification methods, and marks a major benchmark for scalable quantum hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial builds on these ideas, guiding you through implementing the error detection algorithm first on a small-scale random Clifford circuit and then through the task of GHZ state preparation, to help you experiment with error detection on your own quantum circuits."

    "Now we are ready to add coherent Pauli checks into the payload circuit. To do this, we need to construct a \"valid check\" and insert it into the circuit.

It is considered a valid check when the additional operators inserted into the quantum circuit don't logically change the original circuit.\n",
