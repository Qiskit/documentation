    "Such problems are highly relevant for various industries and constitute an\n",
    "important branch of applied mathematics. However, solving non-linear\n",

    "requirement of an exponentially large amount of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is appropriate for equations with increasing complexity and\n",
    "variables, and is the first step to unlock possibilities that were once\n",
