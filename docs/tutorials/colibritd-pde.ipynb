    "\n",
    "This tutorial seeks to teach on an introductory level how to use the QUICK-PDE\n",
    "function to solve complex multi-physics problems on 156Q Heron R2 QPUs by using\n",
    "ColibriTD's H-DES (Hybrid Differential Equation Solver).\n",
    "The underlying algorithm is described in [the H-DES paper.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01130)\n",
    "Note that this solver can also solve non-linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-physics problems - including fluids dynamics, heat diffusion, and material\n",
    "deformation, to name a few - can be ubiquitously described by Partial\n",
    "Differential Equations (PDEs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Such problems are highly relevant for various industries and constitute an\n",
    "important branch of applied mathematics. However, solving non-linear\n",
    "multivariate coupled PDEs with classical tools remains challenging due to the\n",
    "requirement of an exponentially large amount of resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is appropriate for equations with increasing complexity and\n",
    "variables, and is the first step to unlock possibilities that were once\n",
    "considered intractable. To fully describe a problem modeled by PDEs, it is\n",
    "necessary to know the initial and boundary conditions. These can strongly\n",
    "change the solution of the PDE and the path to find their solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the parameters of the initial condition function.\n",
    "2. Adjust the qubit number (used to encode the function of the differential equation), depth, and shot number.\n",
    "3. Run QUICK-PDE to solve the underlying differential equation."

    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers the user experience from two perspectives: the\n",
    "physical problem determined by the initial conditions, and the algorithmic\n",
    "component in solving a fluid dynamics example on a quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has a broad range of applications, and thus it is\n",
    "important to study and solve the underlying PDEs. An important family of PDEs\n",
    "are the Navier-Stokes equations, which are a system of nonlinear partial\n",
    "differential equations describing the motion of fluids. They are highly relevant\n",
    "for scientific problems and engineering applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under certain conditions, the Navier-Stokes equations reduce to Burgers'\n",
    "equation, a convection–diffusion equation describing phenomena occurring in\n",
    "fluid dynamics, gas dynamics, and nonlinear acoustics, to name a few, by modeling\n",
    "dissipative systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-dimensional version of the equation depends on two variables:\n",
    "$t \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ modeling the temporal dimension, $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$\n",
    "representing the spatial dimension. The general form of the equation is called\n",
    "the viscous Burgers' equation and reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial^2 x},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $u(x,t)$ is the fluid speed field at a given position $x$ and time $t$, and $\\nu$\n",
    "is the viscosity of the fluid. Viscosity is an important property of a fluid\n",
    "that measures its rate-dependent resistance to motion or deformation, and thus it\n",
    "plays a crucial role in the determination of the dynamics of a fluid. When the\n",
    "viscosity of the fluid is null ($\\nu$ = 0), the equation becomes a conservation\n",
    "equation that can develop discontinuities (shock waves), due to the lack of its\n",
    "internal resistance. In this case, the equation is called the inviscid Burgers'\n",
    "equation and is a special case of nonlinear wave equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, inviscid flows do not occur in nature, but when modeling\n",
    "aerodynamic flow, due to the infinitesimal effect of transport, using an\n",
    "inviscid description of the problem can be useful. Surprisingly, more than\n",
    "70% of aerodynamic theory deals with inviscid flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we offer the inviscid Burgers' equation as a CFD example to solve\n",
    "on IBM&reg; QPUs using QUICK-PDE, given by the equation:\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial condition for this problem is set to a linear function:\n",
    "$$u(t=0,x) = ax + b,\\text{ with }a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}$$\n",
