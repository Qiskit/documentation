    "Long-range entanglement between distant qubits on a quantum processor can be a challenging task for devices with limited qubit connectivity. This tutorial shows three different ways that can be used to generate long-range entanglement between qubits on a line, at varying distances between each other:\n",
    "- a unitary-based implementation, which uses SWAP operations to reduce the distance between distant qubits and entangle them directly,\n",
    "- a measurement-based implementation with dynamic circuits, which uses measurement and feedforward of information during the quantum computation to entangle the qubits.\n",
    "In particular, the results show the effectiveness of dynamic circuits in generating long-range entanglement between two unconnected qubits at utility scales.\n",
