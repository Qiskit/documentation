    "Long-range entanglement between distant qubits on a quantum processor can be a challenging task for devices with limited qubit connectivity. This tutorial shows three different ways that can be used to generate long-range entanglement between qubits on a line, at varying distances between each other:\n",
    "- a unitary-based implementation, which uses SWAP operations to reduce the distance between distant qubits and entangle them directly,\n",
    "- a measurement-based implementation with post-processing, which  discards some amount of information to generate the desired entangled state, and\n",
    "- a measurement-based implementation with dynamic circuits, which uses measurement and feedforward of information during the quantum computation to entangle the qubits.\n",
    "In particular, the results show the effectiveness of dynamic circuits in generating long-range entanglement between two unconnected qubits at utility scales.\n",

    "#### Monte Carlo state certification\n",
    "Next, you utilize the methods `prep_P_ij_conj` and `meas_P_kl` to prepare the circuits for Monte Carlo state certification. The method can be used to calculate the average state fidelity of the state prepared by a circuit without having to estimate the full quantum state (for example with state tomography or similar technqiques). For more details see the [Appendix](#appendix-calculating-the-average-fidelity). Monte Carlo state certification requires us to prepare the complex conjugate of random product of eigenstates of local Pauli operators, corresponding to the Paulis $P_i^*$ and $P_j^*$ - and then to measure the the final state in different Pauli bases, corresponding to the Pauli operators $P_k$ and $P_l$. You can do this with the following two methods: the `prep_P_ij_conj` method prepares a list of circuits so that the control and target qubits are in the eigenstates of $P_i^*$ and $P_j^*$, respectively; and the `meas_P_kl` method prepares a list of circuits so that the control and target qubits are measured in the $P_k$ and $P_l$ bases, respectively."

    "To appreciate the results visually, the cell below plots the estimated gate fidelities measured at varying distance between entangled qubits for the three different methods. In general, the fidelity will decrease with increasing distance. The results show that although the unitary method (using SWAPs to implement a long-range entangling interaction) performs better at short distances, there is a cross-over to a regime where dynamic circuits become a better option. This is true for both the measurement-and-feedforward technique as well as the post-processing one."
