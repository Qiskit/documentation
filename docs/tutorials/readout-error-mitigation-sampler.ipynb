    "*Estimated QPU usage: 1 minute (tested on IBM `ibm_kingston`)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the Estimator primitive, the Sampler primitive does not have built-in support for error mitigation.\n",
    "Several of the methods supported by the Estimator are specifically designed for expectation values, and hence are not applicable to the Sampler primitive.\n",
    "However, readout error mitigation is a highly effective method that is also applicable to the Sampler primitive.\n",
    "This tutorial explains how to use the [M3 Qiskit addon](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mthree/) to mitigate readout error for the Sampler primitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The M3 Qiskit addon implements an efficient method for readout error mitigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is readout error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Immediately before measurement, the state of a qubit register is\n",
    "described by a superposition of computational basis states,\n",
    "or by a density matrix.\n",
    "Measurement of the qubit register into a classical bit register then proceeds in two steps.\n",
    "First the quantum measurement proper is performed.\n",
    "This means that the state of the qubit register\n",
    "is projected onto a single basis state that is characterized\n",
    "by a string of $1$s and $0$s.\n",
    "The second step consists of reading the bitstring characterizing this basis state\n",
    "and writing it into classical computer memory.\n",
    "We call this step *readout*.\n",
    "It turns out that readout error is more important than error due to to incorrectly collapsing the state.\n",
    "This makes sense when you recall that readout requires detecting a microscopic\n",
    "quantum state and amplfying it to the macroscopic realm. A readout resonator is coupled to\n",
    "the (transmon) qubit, thereby experiencing a very small frequency shift. A microwave pulse\n",
    "is then bounced off of the resonator, in turn experiencing small changes in its\n",
    "characteristics.  The reflected pulse is then amplified and analyzed.  This is a delicate\n",
    "process subject to a host of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important point is that, while both quantum measurement and readout are subject to error, the\n",
    "latter incurs the dominant error, called readout error.\n",
    "In the following we be concerned only with readout error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical background\n",
    "\n",
    "If the sampled bitstring (stored in classical memory) differs from the bitstring characterizing\n",
    "the projected quantum state, we say that a readout error has occurred.\n",
    "These errors are observed to be random and uncorrelated from sample to sample.\n",
    "It has proven useful to model readout error as a _noisy classical channel_.\n",
    "That is, for every pair of\n",
    "bitstrings $i$ and $j$, there is fixed probability that a true value of $j$ will\n",
    "be incorrectly read as $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, for every pair of bitstrings $(i, j)$, there is a (conditional) probability $\\Mm_{i,j}$\n",
    "that $i$ is read, given that the true value is $j$.\n",
    "That is,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\Mm_{i,j} =  \\Pr(\\text{readout value is } i | \\text{true value is } j)\n",
    "    \\text{ for } i,j \\in (0,...,2^n - 1), \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of bits in the readout register.\n",
    "For concreteness, we assume that $i$ is a decimal integer whose binary representation is\n",
    "the bitstring that labels the computational basis states.\n",
    "We call the $2^n \\times 2^n$ matrix $\\Mm$ the _assignment matrix_.\n",
    "For fixed true value $j$, summing the probability over all noisy outcomes $i$ must give one. That is\n",

    "If an experiment involves estimating a probability distribution over output bitstrings by repeated sampling,\n",
    "then we can use $\\Mm$ to mitigate readout error at the level of the distribution.\n",
    "The first step is to repeat a fixed circuit of interest many times,\n",
    "creating a histogram of sampled bitstrings.\n",

    "Further limitations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The recovered distribution $\\pideal$ may have one\n",
    "  or more negative probabilities (while still summing to one). One solution\n",
