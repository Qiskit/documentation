    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces advanced techniques to improve the performance of the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** with a large number of qubits.\n",
    "Please see [Solve utility-scale quantum optimization problems](/docs/tutorials/quantum-approximate-optimization-algorithm) for an introduction to QAOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advanced techniques in this notebook include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SWAP strategy with SAT initial mapping**: This is a specifically designed transpiler pass for QAOA that uses a SWAP strategy and a SAT solver together to improve the selection of which physical qubits on the QPU to use. The SWAP strategy exploits the commutativity of the QAOA operators to reorder gates so that layers of SWAP gates can be simultaneously executed, thus reducing the depth of the circuit [\\[1\\]](#references). The SAT solver is used to find an initial mapping that minimizes the number of SWAP operations needed to map the qubits in the circuit to the physical qubits on the device [\\[2\\]](#references) .\n",
    "- **CVaR cost function**: Typically the expected value of the cost Hamiltonian is used as the cost function for QAOA, but as was shown in [\\[3\\]](#references) , focusing on the tail of the distribution, rather than the expected value, can improve the performance of QAOA for combinatorial optimization problems. The CVaR accomplishes this. For a given set of shots with corresponding objective values of the considered optimization problem, the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) with confidence level $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$ is defined as the average of the $\\alpha$ best shots [\\[3\\]](#references).\n",
    "Thus, $\\alpha = 1$ corresponds to the standard expected value, while $\\alpha=0$ corresponds to the minimum of the given shots, and $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$ is a tradeoff between focusing on better shots, while still applying some averaging to smooth out the optimization landscape. Additionally, the CVaR can be used as an error mitigation technique to improve the quality of the objective value estimation [\\[4\\]](#references)."

    "Even when a circuit consists of commuting gates (this is the case for the QAOA circuit, but also for Trotterized simulations of Ising Hamiltonians), finding a good initial mapping is a challenging task. The SAT-based approach presented in [\\[2\\]](#references) enables the discovery of effective initial mappings for circuits with commuting gates, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of required SWAP layers. This approach has been demonstrated to scale to up to *500 qubits*, as illustrated in the paper.\n",
