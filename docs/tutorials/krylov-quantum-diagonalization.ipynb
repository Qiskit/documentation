    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to implement the Krylov Quantum Diagonalization Algorithm (KQD) within the context of Qiskit patterns. You will first learn about the theory behind the algorithm and then see a demonstration of its execution on a QPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across disciplines, we're interested in learning ground state properties of quantum systems. Examples include understanding the fundamental nature of particles and forces, predicting and understanding the behavior of complex materials and understanding bio-chemical interactions and reactions. Because of the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the correlation that arise in entangled systems, classical algorithm struggle to solve this problem for quantum systems of increasing size. At one end of the spectrum, existing approach that take advantage of the quantum hardware focus on variational quantum methods (e.g., [variational quantum eigensolver](/docs/tutorials/variational-quantum-eigensolver)). These techniques face challenges with current devices because of the high number of function calls required in the optimization process, which adds a large overhead in resources once advanced error mitigation techniques are introduced, thus limiting their efficacy to small systems. At the other end of the spectrum, there are fault-tolerant quantum methods with performance guarantees (e.g., [quantum phase estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604193)) which require deep circuits that can be executed only on a fault-tolerant device. For these reasons, we introduce here a quantum algorithm based on subspace methods (as described in this [review paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00178)), the Krylov quantum diagonalization (KQD) algorithm. This algorithm performs well at large scale [\\[1\\]](#references) on existing quantum hardware, shares similar [performance guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07492) as phase estimation, is compatible with advanced error mitigation techniques and could provide results that are classically inaccessible."

Given that the $\\mathcal{K}_U$ has dimension $r$, the Hamiltonian projected into the subspace will have dimensions $r \\times r$. With $r$ small enough (generally $r<<100$ is sufficient to obtain convergence of estimates of eigenenergies) we can then easily diagonalize the projected Hamiltonian $\\tilde{H}$. However, we cannot directly diagonalize $\\tilde{H}$ because of the non-orthogonality of the Krylov space vectors. We'll have to measure their overlaps and construct a matrix $\\tilde{S}$\n",

This is highlighted in the figure by the color scheme for the matrix elements and the corresponding $\\text{Prep} \\; \\psi_i$, $\\text{Prep} \\; \\psi_j$ operations. Thus, a set of Hadamard tests for all the possible combinations of Krylov space vectors is required to compute all the matrix elements of the projected Hamiltonian $\\tilde{H}$. The top wire in the Hadamard test circuit is an ancilla qubit which is measured either in the X or Y basis, its expectation value determines the value of the overlap between the states. The bottom wire represents all the qubits of the system Hamiltonian. The $\\text{Prep} \\; \\psi_i$ operation prepares the system qubit in the state $\\vert \\psi_i \\rangle$ controlled by the state of the ancilla qubit (similarly for $\\text{Prep} \\; \\psi_j$) and the operation $P$ represents Pauli decomposition of the system Hamiltonian $H = \\sum_i P_i$.

    "### Decompose time-evolution operator with Trotter decomposition\n",
    "Instead of implementing the time-evolution operator exactly we can use the Trotter decomposition to implement an approximation of it. Repeating several times a certain order Trotter decomposition gives us further reduction of the error introduced from the approximation. In the following, we directly build the Trotter implementation in the most efficient way for the interaction graph of the Hamiltonian we are considering (nearest neighbor interactions only). In practice we insert Pauli rotations $R_{xx}$, $R_{yy}$, $R_{zz}$ with a parametrized angle $t$ which correspond to the approximate implementation of $e^{-i (XX + YY + ZZ) t}$. Given the difference in definition of the Pauli rotations and the time-evolution that we are trying to implement, we'll have to use the parameter $2*dt$ to achieve a time-evolution of $dt$. Furthermore, we reverse the order of the operations for odd number of repetitions of the Trotter steps, which is functionally equivalent but allows for synthesizing adjacent operations in a single $SU(2)$ unitary. This gives a much shallower circuit than what is obtained using the generic `PauliEvolutionGate()` functionality."
