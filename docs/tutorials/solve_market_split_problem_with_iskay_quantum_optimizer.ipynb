    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to solve the Market Split problem using [Kipu Quantum's Iskay quantum optimizer](/docs/guides/kipu-optimization) [1]. The Market Split problem represents a real-world resource allocation challenge where markets must be partitioned into balanced sales regions to meet exact demand targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Market Split Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The Market Split problem presents a deceptively simple yet computationally formidable challenge in resource allocation. Consider a company with $m$ products being sold across $n$ different markets, where each market purchases a specific bundle of products (represented by the columns of matrix $A$). The business objective is to partition these markets into two balanced sales regions such that each region receives exactly half the total demand for every product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We seek a binary assignment vector $x$, where:\n",
    "- $x_j = 1$ assigns market $j$ to Region A\n",
    "- $x_j = 0$ assigns market $j$ to Region B  \n",
    "- The constraint $Ax = b$ must be satisfied, where $b$ represents the target sales (typically half the total demand per product)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we minimize the squared constraint violation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(x) = ||Ax - b||^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij}x_j - b_i\\right)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $A_{ij}$ represents the sales of product $i$ in market $j$\n",
    "- $x_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is the binary assignment of market $j$  \n",
    "- $b_i$ is the target sales for product $i$ in each region\n",
    "- The cost equals zero precisely when all constraints are satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "Each term in the sum represents the squared deviation from the target sales for a particular product. When we expand this cost function, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C(x) = x^T A^T A x - 2b^T A x + b^T b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $b^T b$ is a constant, minimizing $C(x)$ is equivalent to minimizing the quadratic function $x^T A^T A x - 2b^T A x$, which is exactly a QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computational Complexity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its straightforward business interpretation, this problem exhibits remarkable computational intractability:\n",
    "- **Small Scale Failure**: Conventional Mixed Integer Programming solvers fail on instances with as few as 7 products under a timeout of one hour [4]\n",
    "- **Exponential Growth**: The solution space grows exponentially ($2^n$ possible assignments), making brute force approaches infeasible\n",
    "\n",
    "This severe computational barrier, combined with its practical relevance to territory planning and resource allocation, makes the Market Split problem an ideal benchmark for quantum optimization algorithms [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes Iskay's Approach Unique?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Iskay optimizer uses the **bf-DCQO (bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization)** algorithm [1], which represents a significant advancement in quantum optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Circuit Efficiency**: The bf-DCQO algorithm achieves remarkable gate reduction [1]:\n",
    "- Up to **10 times fewer entangling gates** than Digital Quantum Annealing (DQA)\n",
    "- Significantly shallower circuits enable:\n",
    "  - Less error accumulation during quantum execution\n",
    "  - Ability to tackle larger problems on current quantum hardware  \n",
    "  - No need for error mitigation techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Variational Design**: Unlike variational algorithms requiring approximately 100 iterations, bf-DCQO typically needs only **approximately 10 iterations** [1]. This is achieved through:\n",
    "- Intelligent bias-field calculations from measured state distributions\n",
    "- Starting each iteration from an energy state near the previous solution\n",
    "- Integrated classical post-processing with local search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counterdiabatic Protocols**: The algorithm incorporates counterdiabatic terms that suppress unwanted quantum excitations during short evolution times, enabling the system to remain near the ground state even with rapid transitions [1]."

Let's examine the actual content of our target instance `ms_03_200_177.dat`:\n\n```text\n3 20\n60   92  161   53   97    2   75   81    6  139  132   45  108  112  181   93  152  200  164   51 1002\n176  196   41  143    2   88    0   79   10   71   75  148   82  135   34  187   33  155   58   46  879\n68   68  179  173  127  163   48   49   99   78   44   52  173  131   73  198   84  109  180   95 1040\n```\n\n**Format Structure:**\n- **First line:** `3 20`\n  - `3` = number of products (constraints/rows in matrix $A$)\n  - `20` = number of markets (variables/columns in matrix $A$)\n\n- **Next 3 lines:** Coefficient matrix $A$ and target vector $b$\n  - Each line has 21 numbers: first 20 are row coefficients, last is the target\n  - Line 2: `60 92 161 ... 51 | 1002`\n    - First 20 numbers: How much of Product 1 each of the 20 markets sells\n    - Last number (1002): Target sales for Product 1 in one region\n  - Line 3: `176 196 41 ... 46 | 879`\n    - Product 2 sales per market and target (879)\n  - Line 4: `68 68 179 ... 95 | 1040`\n    - Product 3 sales per market and target (1040)\n\n**Business Interpretation:**\n- Market 0 sells: 60 units of Product 1, 176 units of Product 2, 68 units of Product 3\n- Market 1 sells: 92 units of Product 1, 196 units of Product 2, 68 units of Product 3\n- And so on for all 20 markets...\n- **Goal**: Split these 20 markets into two regions where each region gets exactly 1002 units of Product 1, 879 units of Product 2, and 1040 units of Product 3\n\n#### QUBO Transformation\n\nThe power of quantum optimization lies in transforming constrained problems into unconstrained quadratic forms. For the Market Split problem, we convert the equality constraints $Ax = b$ (where $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$) into a QUBO by penalizing constraint violations.\n\n**The Penalty Method:**\n\nSince we need $Ax = b$ to hold exactly, we minimize the squared violation:\n\n$$f(x) = ||Ax - b||^2$$\n\nThis equals zero precisely when all constraints are satisfied. Expanding algebraically:\n\n$$f(x) = (Ax - b)^T(Ax - b) = x^T A^T A x - 2b^T A x + b^T b$$\n\n**QUBO Objective:**\n\nSince $b^T b$ is constant, our optimization becomes:\n\n$$\\text{minimize} \\quad Q(x) = x^T(A^T A)x - 2(A^T b)^T x$$\n\n**Key Insight:** This transformation is exact, not approximate. Equality constraints naturally square into quadratic form without requiring auxiliary variables or penalty parameters—making this formulation mathematically elegant and computationally efficient for quantum solvers [3]."

   "source": "### Understanding the bf-DCQO Algorithm\n\nBefore we run the optimization, let's understand the sophisticated quantum algorithm that powers Iskay: **bf-DCQO (bias-field digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization)** [1].\n\n#### What is bf-DCQO?\n\nbf-DCQO is based on the time evolution of a quantum system where the problem solution is encoded in the **ground state** (lowest energy state) of the final quantum Hamiltonian [1]. The algorithm addresses a fundamental challenge in quantum optimization:\n\n**The Challenge**: Traditional adiabatic quantum computing requires very slow evolution to maintain ground state conditions according to the adiabatic theorem. This demands increasingly deep quantum circuits as problem complexity grows, leading to more gate operations and accumulated errors.\n\n**The Solution**: bf-DCQO uses counterdiabatic protocols to enable rapid evolution while maintaining ground state fidelity, dramatically reducing circuit depth.\n\n#### Mathematical Framework\n\nThe algorithm minimizes a cost function of the form:\n\n$$\\min_{(x_1,x_2,...,x_n) \\in D} C(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$$\n\nwhere $D = \\{0,1\\}^n$ for binary variables and:\n\n$$C(x) = a + \\sum_i b_i x_i + \\sum_{i,j} c_{ij} x_i x_j + ... + \\sum g_{k_1,...,k_m} x_{k_1}...x_{k_m}$$\n\nFor our Market Split problem, the cost function is:\n\n$$C(x) = ||Ax - b||^2 = x^T A^T A x - 2 b^T A x + b^T b$$\n\n#### The Role of Counterdiabatic Terms\n\n**Counterdiabatic terms** are additional terms introduced into the time-dependent Hamiltonian that suppress unwanted excitations during the quantum evolution. Here's why they're crucial:\n\nIn adiabatic quantum optimization, we evolve the system according to a time-dependent Hamiltonian:\n\n$$H(t) = \\left(1 - \\frac{t}{T}\\right) H_{\\text{initial}} + \\frac{t}{T} H_{\\text{problem}}$$\n\nwhere $H_{\\text{problem}}$ encodes our optimization problem. To maintain the ground state during rapid evolution, we add counterdiabatic terms:\n\n$$H_{\\text{CD}}(t) = H(t) + H_{\\text{counter}}(t)$$\n\nThese counterdiabatic terms:\n1. **Suppress unwanted transitions**: Prevent the quantum state from jumping to excited states during fast evolution\n2. **Enable shorter evolution times**: Allow us to reach the final state much faster without violating adiabaticity\n3. **Reduce circuit depth**: Shorter evolution leads to fewer gates and less error\n\nThe practical impact is dramatic: bf-DCQO uses up to **10 times fewer entangling gates** than Digital Quantum Annealing [1], making it practical for today's noisy quantum hardware.\n\n#### Bias-Field Iterative Optimization\n\nUnlike variational algorithms that optimize circuit parameters through many iterations, bf-DCQO uses a **bias-field guided approach** that converges in approximately 10 iterations [1]:\n\n**Iteration Process:**\n\n1. **Initial Quantum Evolution**: Start with a quantum circuit implementing the counterdiabatic evolution protocol\n\n2. **Measurement**: Measure the quantum state to obtain a probability distribution over bitstrings\n\n3. **Bias-Field Calculation**: Analyze the measurement statistics and calculate an optimal bias-field $h_i$ for each qubit:\n   $$h_i = \\text{f}(\\text{measurement statistics}, \\text{previous solutions})$$\n   \n4. **Next Iteration**: The bias-field modifies the Hamiltonian for the next iteration:\n   $$H_{\\text{next}} = H_{\\text{problem}} + \\sum_i h_i \\sigma_i^z$$\n   \n   This allows starting near the previously found good solution, effectively performing a form of \"quantum local search\"\n\n5. **Convergence**: Repeat until the solution quality stabilizes or a maximum number of iterations is reached\n\n**Key Advantage**: Each iteration provides meaningful progress toward the optimal solution by incorporating information from previous measurements, unlike variational methods that must explore the parameter space blindly.\n\n#### Integrated Classical Post-Processing\n\nAfter the quantum optimization converges, Iskay performs classical **local search** post-processing:\n\n- **Bit-Flip Exploration**: Systematically or randomly flip bits in the best measured solution\n- **Energy Evaluation**: Calculate $C(x)$ for each modified solution  \n- **Greedy Selection**: Accept improvements that lower the cost function\n- **Multiple Passes**: Perform several passes (controlled by `postprocessing_level`)\n\nThis hybrid approach compensates for bit-flip errors from hardware imperfections and readout errors, ensuring high-quality solutions even on noisy quantum devices.\n\n#### Why bf-DCQO Excels on Current Hardware\n\nThe bf-DCQO algorithm is specifically designed to excel on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices [1]:\n\n1. **Error Resilience**: Fewer gates (10 times reduction) means dramatically less error accumulation\n2. **No Error Mitigation Required**: The algorithm's inherent efficiency eliminates the need for expensive error mitigation techniques [1]\n3. **Scalability**: Can handle problems with up to 156 qubits (156 binary variables) with direct qubit mapping [1]\n4. **Proven Performance**: Achieves 100% approximation ratios on benchmark MaxCut and HUBO instances [1]\n\nNow let's see this powerful algorithm in action on our Market Split problem!"

While naive, it serves as an important reference point:\n\n**How It Works:**\n- Randomly generate binary solutions\n- Evaluate each solution's cost\n- Keep track of the best solution found\n- Terminate when optimal solution is found or iteration limit reached\n\n**Parameters:**\n- Maximum iterations: 10,000,000\n- No heuristics or learning—pure random sampling\n\nThis baseline helps us understand how much benefit comes from intelligent search strategies versus random exploration."

   "source": "#### Interpreting the Comparison Results\n\n**Key Observations:**\n\n1. **Solution Quality (Constraint Violations)**:\n   - **Green bars (value = 0)**: Algorithms that found perfect solutions satisfying all constraints\n   - **Red bars (value > 0)**: Algorithms with constraint violations\n   - For this instance, multiple algorithms can find optimal solutions, demonstrating that the problem is solvable at this scale\n\n2. **Execution Time Trade-offs**:\n   - **Brute Force**: Guaranteed optimal but time increases exponentially with problem size ($O(2^n)$)\n   - **Simulated Annealing**: Often finds good solutions with reasonable time, but no guarantees\n   - **Random Search**: Highly variable performance; may require many samples to find optimal solutions\n   - **Quantum (bf-DCQO)**: Execution time includes quantum circuit preparation, hardware queue time, and post-processing\n\n3. **Scalability Implications**:\n   - For 20 variables: All methods can potentially succeed\n   - For 30+ variables: Brute force becomes impractical ($2^{30} \\approx 1$ billion evaluations)\n   - For 50+ variables: Only quantum and sophisticated heuristics remain viable\n   - For 100+ variables: Quantum optimization with efficient algorithms like bf-DCQO offers the most promising path\n\n4. **When to Use Each Approach**:\n   - **Brute Force**: Only for small problems (< 25 variables) where guaranteed optimality is required\n   - **Simulated Annealing**: Medium-sized problems where good solutions are acceptable and classical resources are limited\n   - **Random Search**: Baseline for comparison or when solutions are abundant in the search space\n   - **Quantum (bf-DCQO)**: Large-scale problems (up to 156 qubits) where classical methods struggle, especially when high-quality solutions are needed and quantum hardware is accessible\n\n**The Quantum Advantage Horizon:**\n\nWhile classical methods may perform competitively at small scales like this 20-variable problem, quantum optimization shines as problems grow larger. The bf-DCQO algorithm's efficiency (10× fewer gates than other quantum approaches) positions it uniquely for the NISQ era, handling problem sizes that challenge both classical solvers and less efficient quantum algorithms."
