    "## Background\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to realize a Nishimori phase transition on an IBM quantum processor. This experiment was originally described in [*Realizing the Nishimori transition across the error threshold for constant-depth quantum circuits*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02863).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nishimori phase transition refers to the transition between short- and long-range ordered phases in the random-bond Ising model. On a quantum computer, the long-range ordered phase manifests as a state in which qubits are entangled across the entire device. This highly entangled state is prepared using the *generation of entanglement by measurement* (GEM) protocol. By utilizing mid-circuit measurements, the GEM protocol is able to entangle qubits across the entire device using circuits of only constant depth. This tutorial uses the implementation of the GEM protocol from the [GEM Suite](https://github.com/qiskit-community/gem-suite) software package."

    "The GEM protocol works on a quantum processor with qubit connectivity described by a lattice. Today's IBM quantum processors use the [heavy hex lattice](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/heavy-hex-lattice). The qubits of the processor are grouped into *plaquettes* based on which unit cell of the lattice they occupy. Because a qubit might occur in more than one unit cell, the plaquettes are not disjoint. On the heavy hex lattice, a plaquette contains 12 qubits. The plaquettes themselves also form lattice, where two plaquettes are connected if they share any qubits. On the heavy hex lattice, neighboring plaquettes share 3 qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the GEM Suite software package, the fundamental class for implementing the GEM protocol is `PlaquetteLattice`, which represents the lattice of plaquettes (which is distinct from the heavy hex lattice). A `PlaquetteLattice` can be initialized from a qubit coupling map. Currently, only heavy hex coupling maps are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code cell initializes a plaquette lattice from the coupling map of a IBM Quantum processor. The plaquette lattice does not always encompass the entire hardware. For example, `ibm_torino` has 133 total qubits, but the largest plaquette lattice that fits on the device uses only 125 of them, and comprises a total of 18 plaquettes. Similar can be observed for IBM Quantum devices with different qubit counts as well."

This partitioning determines how two-qubit gates can be parallelized, as well as different scheduling patterns that are likely to incur different amounts of error on a noisy quantum processor. Because edges in a group are disjoint, a layer of two-qubit gates can be applied on those edges simultaneously. In fact, it is possible to partition the 6 colors into 3 groups of 2 colors such that the union of each group of 2 colors is still disjoint. Therefore, only 3 layers of two-qubit gates are needed to activate every edge. There are 12 ways to so partition the 6 colors, and each such partition yields a different 3-layer gate schedule.\n",

    "1. Prepare the all-$|+\\rangle$ state by applying a Hadamard gate to every qubit.\n",

If the site qubit is labeled (B), then the angle is fixed to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. If the site qubit is labeled (A), then the angle is allowed to vary, producing different circuits. By default, the range of angles is set to 21 equally spaced points between $0$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, inclusive.\n",
    "3. Measure each bond qubit in the Pauli $X$ basis. Since qubits are measured in the Pauli $Z$ basis, this can be accomplished by applying a Hadamard gate before measuring the qubit.\n",

To understand what state the site qubits remain in, it is instructive to consider the case that the $R_{ZZ}$ angle applied to site qubits (A) in step 2 is equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. In this case, the site qubits are left in a highly entangled state similar to the GHZ state,\n",

However, the GHZ state can be recovered by applying a decoding operation based on the measurement outcomes. When the $R_{ZZ}$ angle is tuned down from $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the long-range order can still be recovered up until a critical angle, which in the absence of noise, is approximately $0.3 \\pi$. Below this angle, the resulting state no longer exhibits long-range entanglement. This transition between the presence and absence of long-range order is the Nishimori phase transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the description above, the site qubits were left unmeasured, and the decoding operation can be performed by applying quantum gates. In the experiment as implemented in the GEM suite, which this tutorial follows, the site qubits are in fact measured, and the decoding operation is applied in a classical post-processing step.\n",

This is how the experiment is implemented in the GEM suite, which this tutorial follows.\n",

Typically, the stages that incur the most computational overhead are choosing the qubit layout, routing the two-qubit gates to conform to the qubit connectivity of the hardware, and optimizing the circuit to minimize its gate count and depth. In the GEM protocol, the layout and routing stages are unnecessary because the hardware connectivity is already incorporated into the design of the protocol. The circuits already have a qubit layout, and the two-qubit gates are already mapped onto native connections. Furthermore, in order to preserve the structure of the circuit as the $R_{ZZ}$ angle is varied, only very basic circuit optimization should be performed.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you realized a Nishimori phase transition on a quantum processor using the GEM protocol. The metrics that you examined during post-processing, in particular the two-point correlation and the normalized variance, serve as benchmarks of the device's ability to generate long-range entangled states. These benchmarks extend the utility of the GEM protocol beyond probing interesting physics. As part of the protocol, you entangled qubits across the entire device using circuits of only constant depth. This feat is only possible due to the protocol's use of mid-circuit measurements. In this experiment, the entangled state was immediately measured, but an interesting avenue to explore would be to continue using the state in additional quantum processing!"
