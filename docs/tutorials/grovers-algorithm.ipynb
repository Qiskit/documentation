    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Amplitude amplification is a general purpose quantum algorithm, or subroutine, that can be used to obtain a quadratic speedup over a handful of classical algorithms. [Grover’s algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605043) was the first to demonstrate this speedup on unstructured search problems. Formulating a Grover's search problem requires an oracle function that marks one or more computational basis states as the states we are interested in finding, and an amplification circuit that increases the amplitude of marked states, consequently suppressing the remaining states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate how to construct Grover oracles and use the [`grover_operator()`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.grover_operator) from the Qiskit circuit library to easily set up a Grover's search instance. The runtime `Sampler` primitive allows seamless execution of Grover circuits."

    "Grover's algorithm requires an [oracle](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/grovers-algorithm) that specifies one or more marked computational basis states, where \"marked\" means a state with a phase of -1.  A controlled-Z gate, or its multi-controlled generalization over $N$ qubits, marks the $2^{N}-1$ state (`'1'`*$N$ bit-string).  Marking basis states with one or more `'0'` in the binary representation requires applying X-gates on the corresponding qubits before and after the controlled-Z gate; equivalent to having an open-control on that qubit.  In the following code, we define an oracle that does just that, marking one or more input basis states defined through their bit-string representation.  The `MCMT` gate is used to implement the multi-controlled Z-gate."
