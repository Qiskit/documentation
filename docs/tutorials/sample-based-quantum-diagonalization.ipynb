    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we show how to post-process noisy quantum samples to find an approximation to the ground state of the nitrogen molecule $\\text{N}_2$ at equilibrium bond length, using the [sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05068), for samples taken from a 59-qubit quantum circuit (52 system qubits + 7 ancilla qubits). A Qiskit-based implementation is available in the [SQD Qiskit addons](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd), more details can be found in the corresponding [docs](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-sqd) with a [simple example](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-sqd-get-started) to get started.\n",
    "SQD is a technique for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of quantum operators, such as a quantum system Hamiltonian, using quantum and distributed classical computing together. Classical distributed computing is used to process samples obtained from a quantum processor, and to project and diagonalize a target Hamiltonian in a subspace spanned by them. This allows SQD to be robust to samples corrupted by quantum noise and deal with large Hamiltonians, such as chemistry Hamiltonians with millions of interaction terms, beyond the reach of any exact diagonalization methods. An SQD-based workflow has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a circuit ansatz and apply it on a quantum computer to a reference state (in this case, the [Hartree-Fock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree%E2%80%93Fock_method) state).\n",
    "2. Sample bitstrings from the resulting quantum state.\n",
    "3. Run the *self-consistent configuration recovery* procedure on the bitstrings to obtain the approximation to the ground state.\n",
    "\n",

    "The properties of molecules are largely determined by the structure of the electrons within them. As fermionic particles, electrons can be described using a mathematical formalism called second quantization. The idea is that there are a number of *orbitals*, each of which can be either empty or occupied by a fermion. A system of $N$ orbitals is described by a set of fermionic annihilation operators $\\{\\hat{a}_p\\}_{p=1}^N$ that satisfy the fermionic anticommutation relations,\n",

We then write $\\hat{a}_{p\\sigma}$ for the annihilation operator associated with the spin-orbital with spin $\\sigma$ ($\\sigma \\in \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\}$) in spatial orbital $p$. If we take $N$ to be the number of spatial orbitals, then there are a total of $2N$ spin-orbitals.

The constraints are specified by a list of indices indicating which matrix entries in the upper triangle are allowed to be nonzero (since the matrices are symmetric, only the upper triangle needs to be specified). These indices can be interpreted as pairs of orbitals that are allowed to interact.\n",

    "The self-consistent configuration recovery procedure is designed to extract as much signal as possible from noisy quantum samples. Because the molecular Hamiltonian conserves particle number and spin Z, it makes sense to choose a circuit ansatz that also conserves these symmetries. When applied to the Hartree-Fock state, the resulting state has a fixed particle number and spin Z in the noiseless setting. Therefore, the spin-$\\alpha$ and spin-$\\beta$ halves of any bitstring sampled from this state should have the same [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight) as in the Hartree-Fock state. Due to the presence of noise in current quantum processors, some measured bitstrings will violate this property. A simple form of postselection would discard these bitstrings, but this is wasteful because those bitstrings might still contain some signal. The self-consistent recovery procedure attempts to recover some of that signal in post-processing. The procedure is iterative and requires as input an estimate of the average occupancies of each orbital in the ground state, which is first computed from the raw samples. The procedure is run in a loop, and each iteration has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each bitstring that violates the specified symmetries, flip its bits with a probabilistic procedure designed to bring the bitstring closer to the current estimate of the average orbital occupancies, to obtain a new bitstring.\n",
    "2. Collect all of the old and new bitstrings that satisfy the symmetries, and subsample subsets of a fixed size, chosen in advance.\n",
    "3. For each subset of bitstrings, project the Hamiltonian into the subspace spanned by the corresponding basis vectors (see the [previous section](#quantum-chemistry) for a description of these basis vectors), and compute a ground state estimate of the projected Hamiltonian on a classical computer.\n",
    "4. Update the estimate of the average orbital occupancies with the ground state estimate with the lowest energy.\n",
