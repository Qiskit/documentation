    "## Background\n",
    "The Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) is important for studying quantum magnetism and phase transitions. It describes a set of spins arranged on a lattice, where each spin interacts with its neighbors while also being influenced by an external magnetic field that drives quantum fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach to simulate this model, is to use Trotter decomposition to approximate the time evolution operator, constructing circuits that alternate between single-qubit rotations and entangling two-qubit interactions. However, this simulation on real hardware is challenging due to noise and decoherence, leading to deviations from the true dynamics. To overcome this, we use Q-CTRL’s Fire Opal error suppression and performance management tools, offered as a Qiskit Function [\\[1\\]](#references). Fire Opal automatically optimizes circuit execution by applying error suppression, dynamical decoupling, advanced layout and routing, all aimed at reducing noise. With these improvements, the hardware results align more closely with noiseless simulations, letting us study TFIM magnetization dynamics with higher fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    " In this tutorial we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build the TFIM Hamiltonian on a graph of connected spin triangles,\n",
    "* Simulate time evolution with Trotterized circuits at different depths,\n",
    "* Compute and visualize single-qubit magnetizations $\\langle Z_i \\rangle$ over time,\n",
    "* Compare baseline simulations with results from hardware runs using Q-CTRL’s Fire Opal performance management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transverse-field Ising Model (TFIM) is a quantum spin model that captures essential features of quantum phase transitions. The Hamiltonian is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = -J \\sum_{i} Z_i Z_{i+1} - h \\sum_{i} X_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Z_i$ and $X_i$ are Pauli operators acting on qubit $i$, $J$ is the coupling strength between neighboring spins, and $h$ is the strength of the transverse magnetic field. The first term represents classical ferromagnetic interactions, while the second introduces quantum fluctuations through the transverse field. To simulate TFIM dynamics, you use a Trotter decomposition of the unitary evolution operator $e^{-iHt}$, implemented through layers of RX and RZZ gates based on a custom graph of connected spin triangles. The simulation explores how magnetization $\\langle Z \\rangle$ evolves with increasing Trotter steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFIM implementation performance is obtained by comparing noiseless simulations with noisy backends. Fire Opal’s enhanced execution and error suppression features are used to mitigate the effect of noise in real hardware, yielding more reliable estimates of spin observables like $\\langle Z_i \\rangle$ and correlators $\\langle Z_i Z_j \\rangle$."

    "The list of Trotterized circuits is executed using the `matrix_product_state` simulator with an arbitrary choice of $4096$ shots. The MPS method provides an efficient approximation of the circuit dynamics, with accuracy determined by the chosen bond dimension. For the system sizes considered here, the default bond dimension is sufficient to capture the magnetization dynamics with high fidelity. The raw counts are normalized, and from these we compute the single-qubit expectation values $\\langle Z_i \\rangle$ at each Trotter step. Finally, we calculate the average over all qubits to obtain a single curve that shows how the magnetization changes over time."
