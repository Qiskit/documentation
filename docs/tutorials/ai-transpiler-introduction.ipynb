    "# Qiskit AI-powered transpiler service introduction\n",
    "*Estimated QPU usage: None (NOTE: no execution was done in this notebook as notebook is focused on the transpilation process)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Qiskit AI-powered transpiler service (QTS)** introduces machine learning-based optimizations in both routing and synthesis passes. These AI modes have been designed to tackle the limitations of traditional transpilation, particularly for large-scale circuits and complex hardware topologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features of QTS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Routing passes: AI-powered routing can dynamically adjust qubit paths based on the specific circuit and backend, reducing the need for excessive SWAP gates.\n",
    "    - `AIRouting`: Layout selection and circuit routing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Synthesis passes: AI techniques optimize the decomposition of multi-qubit gates, minimizing the number of two-qubit gates, which are typically more error-prone.\n",
    "    - `AICliffordSynthesis`: Clifford gate synthesis\n",
    "    - `AILinearFunctionSynthesis`: Linear function circuit synthesis\n",
    "    - `AIPermutationSynthesis`: Permutation circuit synthesis\n",
    "    - `AIPauliNetworkSynthesis`: Pauli Network circuit synthesis (only available in the Qiskit Transpiler Service, not in local environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparison with traditional transpilation: The standard Qiskit transpiler is a robust tool that can handle a broad spectrum of quantum circuits effectively. However, when circuits grow larger in scale or hardware configurations become more complex, QTS can deliver additional optimization gains. By using learned models for routing and synthesis, QTS further refines circuit layouts and reduces overhead for challenging or large-scale quantum tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will evaluate the AI modes using both routing and synthesis passes, comparing the results to traditional transpilation to highlight where AI offers performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on QTS, please refer to the [documentation](/docs/guides/ai-transpiler-passes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use AI for quantum circuit transpilation?\n",
    "\n",
    "As quantum circuits grow in size and complexity, traditional transpilation methods struggle to optimize layouts and reduce gate counts efficiently. Larger circuits, particularly those involving hundreds of qubits, impose significant challenges on routing and synthesis due to device constraints, limited connectivity, and qubit error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where AI-powered transpilation offers a potential solution. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the AI-powered transpiler in Qiskit can make smarter decisions about qubit routing and gate synthesis, leading to better optimization of large-scale quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief benchmarking results\n",
    "![Graph showing AI transpiler performance against Qiskit](/docs/images/tutorials/ai-transpiler-introduction/ai-transpiler-benchmarks.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In benchmarking tests, QTS consistently produced shallower, higher-quality circuits compared to the standard Qiskit transpiler. For these tests, we used Qiskit’s default pass manager strategy, configured with [`generate_preset_passmanager`](/docs/api/qiskit/transpiler_preset). While this default strategy is often effective, it can struggle with larger or more complex circuits. By contrast, QTS’s AI-powered passes achieved an average 24% reduction in two-qubit gate counts and a 36% reduction in circuit depth for large circuits (100+ qubits) when transpiling to the heavy-hex topology of IBM Quantum&reg; hardware. For more information on these benchmarks, please refer to the [blog.](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-performance)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the key benefits of QTS and how it compares to traditional methods."

The results show a significant improvement in the circuit's depth, gate count, and transpilation time when using the AI transpiler:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Circuit depth: This reduction in depth is substantial (over 50%), as it means the AI transpiler has found a more efficient arrangement of qubit interactions, which can directly impact the overall fidelity of the circuit on quantum hardware. A shallower circuit helps mitigate qubit decoherence and reduces the likelihood of noise affecting the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gate count: The AI transpiler also reduced the gate count by nearly 50%. Since each gate has an associated error rate, fewer gates directly lower the overall chance of error, which is critical for maintaining coherence and improving the reliability of results in practical quantum computing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transpilation time efficiency: While the time varies for the device, the time it took to transpile the circuit was drastically reduced, over a 50% improvement. This shows that the AI-powered transpiler not only optimizes the resulting circuit but also improves the efficiency of the transpilation process itself, making it faster to generate optimized circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that these results are based on just one circuit. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of how the AI transpiler compares to traditional methods, it is necessary to test a variety of circuits. The performance of QTS can vary greatly depending on the type of circuit being optimized.

    "## Limitations of QTS\n",
    "\n",
    "While QTS can offer significant performance benefits for large and complex quantum circuits, there are several service-level constraints and AI pass–specific considerations to be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum two-qubit gates per circuit\n",
    "  Each circuit can include up to one million two-qubit gates in any AI mode.\n",
    "- Transpilation run time\n",
    "  Each transpilation process can run for up to 30 minutes. If it exceeds this limit, the job will be canceled.\n",
    "- Retrieve results\n",
    "  You must retrieve the transpilation result within 20 minutes after the process finishes. After that, the result is discarded.\n",
    "- Job queue time\n",
    "  A set of circuits can remain in the internal queue for up to 120 minutes while waiting to be transpiled. If the process doesn’t start within this window, the job is canceled.\n",
    "- Qubit limit\n",
    "  Currently, there is no strictly defined maximum number of qubits. However, the service has been tested successfully with circuits of 900+ qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "While QTS often delivers significant improvements in gate count and circuit depth, overall transpilation performance can vary based on circuit size, connectivity, and runtime constraints. Larger or more complex circuits may still incur additional transpilation time or require specialized configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the latest and most detailed information about QTS constraints, please refer to the [QTS Limitations documentation](/docs/guides/qiskit-transpiler-service#limits-of-the-qiskit-transpiler-service)."
