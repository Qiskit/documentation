    "# Qiskit AI-powered transpiler service introduction\n",
    "*Estimated QPU usage: None (NOTE: This tutorial does not execute jobs because it is focused on transpilation)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Qiskit AI-powered transpiler service (QTS)** introduces machine learning-based optimizations in both routing and synthesis passes. These AI modes have been designed to tackle the limitations of traditional transpilation, particularly for large-scale circuits and complex hardware topologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of **July 2025**, the **Transpiler Service** has been migrated to the new IBM Quantum® Platform and is no currently longer available. For the latest updates about the status of the transpiler service, please refer to the [transpiler service documentation](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/qiskit-transpiler-service). You can still use the AI transpiler locally in almost the same way as standard Qiskit transpilation. Simply replace `generate_preset_pass_manager()` with `generate_ai_pass_manager()`. This function constructs a pass manager that integrates the AI-powered routing and synthesis passes directly into your local transpilation workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key features of AI Passes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Routing passes: AI-powered routing can dynamically adjust qubit paths based on the specific circuit and backend, reducing the need for excessive SWAP gates.\n",
    "    - `AIRouting`: Layout selection and circuit routing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Synthesis passes: AI techniques optimize the decomposition of multi-qubit gates, minimizing the number of two-qubit gates, which are typically more error-prone.\n",
    "    - `AICliffordSynthesis`: Clifford gate synthesis\n",
    "    - `AILinearFunctionSynthesis`: Linear function circuit synthesis\n",
    "    - `AIPermutationSynthesis`: Permutation circuit synthesis\n",
    "    - `AIPauliNetworkSynthesis`: Pauli Network circuit synthesis (only available in the Qiskit Transpiler Service, not in local environment)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparison with traditional transpilation: The standard Qiskit transpiler is a robust tool that can handle a broad spectrum of quantum circuits effectively. However, when circuits grow larger in scale or hardware configurations become more complex, AI passes can deliver additional optimization gains. By using learned models for routing and synthesis, QTS further refines circuit layouts and reduces overhead for challenging or large-scale quantum tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial evaluates the AI modes using both routing and synthesis passes, comparing the results to traditional transpilation to highlight where AI offers performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the available AI passes, see the [AI passes documentation](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/ai-transpiler-passes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use AI for quantum circuit transpilation?\n",
    "\n",
    "As quantum circuits grow in size and complexity, traditional transpilation methods struggle to optimize layouts and reduce gate counts efficiently. Larger circuits, particularly those involving hundreds of qubits, impose significant challenges on routing and synthesis due to device constraints, limited connectivity, and qubit error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where AI-powered transpilation offers a potential solution. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the AI-powered transpiler in Qiskit can make smarter decisions about qubit routing and gate synthesis, leading to better optimization of large-scale quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief benchmarking results\n",
    "![Graph showing AI transpiler performance against Qiskit](/docs/images/tutorials/ai-transpiler-introduction/ai-transpiler-benchmarks.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In benchmarking tests, QTS consistently produced shallower, higher-quality circuits compared to the standard Qiskit transpiler. For these tests, we used Qiskit’s default pass manager strategy, configured with [`generate_preset_passmanager`]. While this default strategy is often effective, it can struggle with larger or more complex circuits. By contrast, QTS’s AI-powered passes achieved an average 24% reduction in two-qubit gate counts and a 36% reduction in circuit depth for large circuits (100+ qubits) when transpiling to the heavy-hex topology of IBM Quantum&reg; hardware. For more information on these benchmarks, refer to this [blog.](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-performance)\n",

    "- **Gate count:** The total gate count remains similar between the two methods. This aligns with expectations since the standard SABRE-based transpilation explicitly minimizes swap count, which dominates gate overhead. The AI transpiler instead prioritizes overall depth and may occasionally trade off a few additional gates for a shorter execution path.\n",

    "- **Transpilation time:** The AI transpiler takes longer to run than the standard method. This is due to the added computational cost of invoking learned models during routing and synthesis. In contrast, the SABRE-based transpiler is now significantly faster after being rewritten and optimized in Rust, providing highly efficient heuristic routing at scale.\n",

In benchmarking tests, it has consistently outperformed traditional methods, delivering significantly shallower circuits and reducing gate counts, which are critical for enhancing performance and mitigating noise on real quantum hardware.\n",

Such transformations are essential for implementing complex quantum algorithms on near-term devices, where interactions often span beyond nearest neighbors.\n",

By contrast, generic synthesis approaches often struggle to balance gate count and circuit depth, especially in scenarios with dense qubit interactions or when attempting to achieve full connectivity.\n",

This example will demonstrate how the AI transpiler optimizes for lower circuit depth and gate count, highlighting its advantages in practical quantum workflows.
