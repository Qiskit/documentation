    "## Background\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to run real-time characterization experiments and update backend properties to improve qubit selection when mapping a circuit to the physical qubits on a QPU. You will learn the basic characterization experiments that are used to determine properties of the QPU, how to do them in Qiskit, and how to update the properties saved in the backend object representing the QPU based on these experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The QPU-reported properties are updated once a day, but the system may drift faster than the time between updates. This can affect the reliability of the qubit selection routines in the `Layout` stage of the pass manager, as they'd be using reported properties that don't represent the present state of the QPU. For this reason, it may be worth devoting some QPU time to characterization experiments, which can then be used to update the QPU properties used by the `Layout` routine."

    "### QPU properties over time\n",
    "Looking at the reported QPU properties over time (we'll consider a single week below), we see how these can fluctuate on a scale of a single day. Small fluctuations can happen even within a day. In this scenario, the reported properties (updated once per day) will not accurately capture the current status of the QPU. Moreover, if a job is transpiled locally (using current reported properties) and submitted but executed only at a later time (minutes or days), it may run the risk of having used outdated properties for qubit selection in the transpilation step. This highlights the importance of having updated information about the QPU at execution time. First, let's retrieve the properties over a certain time range."

    "In this section, we'll investigate the importance of having updated information on qubit properties of the QPU for optimal results. First, we'll carry out a full suite of QPU characterization experiments ($T_1$, $T_2$, SPAM, single-qubit RB and two-qubit RB), which we can then use to update the backend properties. This allows the pass manager to select qubits for the execution based on fresh information about the QPU, possibly improving execution performances. Second, we execute the Bell pair circuit and we compare the fidelity obtained after selecting the qubits with update QPU properties to the fidelity we obtained before when we use the default reported properties for qubit selection."
