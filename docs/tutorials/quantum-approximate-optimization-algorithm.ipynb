    "This tutorial demonstrates how to implement the **Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)** – a hybrid (quantum-classical) iterative method – within the context of Qiskit patterns. You will first solve the **Maximum-Cut** (or **Max-Cut**) problem for a small graph and then learn how to execute it at utility scale. All the hardware executions in the tutorial should run within the time limit for the freely-accessible Open Plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Max-Cut problem is an optimization problem that is hard to solve (more specifically, it is an *NP-hard* problem) with a number of different applications in clustering, network science, and statistical physics. This tutorial considers a graph of nodes connected by edges, and aims to partition it into separate graphs such that they are both as large as possible. Put another way, the goal of this problem is to partition the nodes of a graph into two sets such that the number of edges traversed by this cut is maximized.\n",

    "Finally, you can plot the cumulative distribution function to visualize how each sample contributes to the total probability distribution and the corresponding objective value. The horizontal spread shows the range of objective values of the samples in the final distribution. Ideally, you would see that the cumulative distribution function has \"jumps\" at the lower end of the objective function value axis. This would mean that few solutions with low cost have high probability of being sampled. A smooth, wide curve indicates that each sample is similarly likely, and they can have very different objective values, low or high."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrated how to solve an optimization problem with a quantum computer using the Qiskit patterns framework. The demonstration included a utility-scale example, with circuit sizes that cannot be exactly simulated classically. Currently, quantum computers do not outperform classical computers for combinatorial optimization because of noise. However, the hardware is steadily improving, and new algorithms for quantum computers are continually being developed. Indeed, much of the research working on quantum heuristics for combinatorial optimization is tested with classical simulations that only allow for a small number of qubits, typically around 20 qubits. Now, with larger qubit counts and devices with less noise, researchers will be able to start benchmarking these quantum heuristics at large problem sizes on quantum hardware."
