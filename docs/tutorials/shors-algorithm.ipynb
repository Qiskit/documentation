    "# Shor's algorithm\n",
    "[Shor's algorithm,](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0036144598347011) developed by Peter Shor in 1994, is a groundbreaking quantum algorithm for factoring integers in polynomial time. Its significance lies in its ability to factor large integers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm, threatening the security of widely used cryptographic systems like RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. By efficiently solving this problem on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, Shor's algorithm could revolutionize fields such as cryptography, cybersecurity, and computational mathematics, underscoring the transformative power of quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on demonstrating Shor's algorithm by factoring 15 on a quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define the order finding problem and construct corresponding circuits from the quantum phase estimation protocol. Next, we run the order finding circuits on real hardware using shortest-depth circuits we can transpile. The last section completes Shor's algorithm by connecting the order finding problem to integer factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We end the tutorial with a discussion on other demonstrations of Shor's algorithm on real hardware, focusing on both generic implementations and those tailored to factoring specific integers such as 15 and 21."

The first ingredient in the phase estimation circuit are the controlled-unitary operations that are responsible for performing a *phase kickback* to their corresponding control qubit. These controlled unitaries are exponentiated in accordance to the position of the control qubit, ranging from the least significant bit to the most significant bit. Since $\\ket{\\psi}$ is an eigenvector of $U$, the state of the bottom $n$ qubits is not affected by this operation, but the phase information of the eigenvalue propagates to the top $m$ qubits."

    "It turns out that after the phase kickback operation via controlled-unitaries, all possible states of the top $m$ qubits are orthonormal to each other for each eigenvector $\\ket{\\psi}$ of the unitary $U$. Therefore, these states are perfectly distinguishable, and we can rotate the basis they form back to the computational basis to make a measurement. A mathematical analysis shows that this rotation matrix corresponds to the inverse quantum Fourier transform (QFT) in $2^m$-dimensional Hilbert space. The intuition behind this is that the periodic structure of the modular exponentiation operators is encoded in the quantum state, and the QFT converts this periodicity into measurable peaks in the frequency domain.\n",

Note that it's implicit that we're taking the product modulo $N$ inside of the ket on the right-hand side of the equation. A mathematical analysis shows that $M_a$ is an unitary operator. Furthermore, it turns out that $M_a$ has eigenvector and eigenvalue pairs that allow us to connect the order $r$ of $a$ to the phase estimation problem.

However, it's not easy to do so, and we need to consider an alternative.\n",

    "Let's consider what the circuit would result in if we prepare the computational state $\\ket{1}$ as the initial state. This is not an eigenstate of $M_a$, but it is the uniform superposition of the eigenstates we just described above. In other words, the following relation holds. $$ \\ket{1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}} \\sum^{r-1}_{k=0} \\ket{\\psi_k} $$\n",

    "We saw that $M_b$ operators for a given $b \\in \\mathbb{Z}^*_N$ are permutation operations. Due to the relatively small size of the permutation problem that we have here, since $N=15$ requires only four qubits, we were able to synthesize these operations directly with ``SWAP`` gates by inspection. In general, this might not be a scalable approach. Instead, we might need to construct the permutation matrix explicitly, and use Qiskit's ``UnitaryGate`` class and transpilation methods to synthesize this permutation matrix. However, this can result in significantly deeper circuits. An example follows."

    "The seminal work [[3]](#references) from IBM&reg; demonstrated Shor's algorithm for the first time, factoring the number 15 into its prime factors 3 and 5 using a seven-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer. Another experiment [[4]](#references) factored 15 using photonic qubits. By employing a single qubit recycled multiple times and encoding the work register in higher-dimensional states, the researchers reduced the required number of qubits to one-third of that in the standard protocol, utilizing a two-photon compiled algorithm. A significant paper in the demonstration of Shor's algorithm is [[5]](#references), which uses Kitaev's iterative phase estimation [[8]](#references) technique to reduce the qubit requirement of the algorithm. Authors used seven control qubits and four cache qubits, together with the implementation of modular multipliers. This implementation, however, requires mid-circuit measurements with feed-forward operations and qubit recycling with reset operations. This demonstration was done on an ion-trap quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "More recent work [[6]](#references) focused on factoring 15, 21, and 35 on IBM Quantum&reg; hardware. Similar to previous work, researchers used a compiled version of the algorithm that employed a semi-classical quantum Fourier transform as proposed by Kitaev to minimize the number of physical qubits and gates. A most recent work [[7]](#references) also performed a proof-of-concept demonstration for factoring the integer 21. This demonstration also involved the use of a compiled version of the quantum phase estimation routine, and built upon the previous demonstration by [[4]](#references). Authors went beyond this work by using a configuration of approximate Toffoli gates with residual phase shifts. The algorithm was implemented on IBM quantum processors using only five qubits, and the presence of entanglement between the control and register qubits was verified successfully."

    "We note that RSA encryption typically involves key sizes on the order of 2048 to 4096 bits. Attempting to factor a 2048-bit number with Shor's algorithm will result in a quantum circuit with millions of qubits, including the error correction overhead and a circuit depth on the order of a billion, which is beyond the limits of current quantum hardware to execute. Therefore, Shor's algorithm will require either optimized circuit construction methods or robust quantum error correction to be practically viable for breaking modern cryptographic systems.
