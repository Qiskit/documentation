    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to simulate the dynamics of a canonical quantum spin model, the 2D tilted-field Ising (TFI) model with non clifford angles using [QESEM Qedma's qiskit function](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/qedma-qesem):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = J \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} Z_i Z_j + g_x \\sum_i X_i + g_z \\sum_i Z_i ,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ \\langle i,j \\rangle $ denotes nearest neighbors on a lattice. Simulating the time evolution of many-body quantum systems is a computationally hard task for classical computers. Quantum computers, by contrast, are naturally designed to perform this task efficiently. The TFI model, in particular, has become a popular benchmark on quantum hardware due to its rich physical behavior and hardware friendly implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of simulating continuous-time dynamics, we adopt the closely related kicked Ising model. The dynamics can be expressed exactly as a periodic quantum circuit, where each evolution step consists of three layers of fractional two-qubit gates $ R_{ZZ} (\\alpha_{ZZ}) $, interleaved with layers of single-qubit gates $ R_X (\\alpha_X) $ and $ R_Z (\\alpha_Z) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use generic angles that are challenging for both classical simulation and error mitigation. Specifically, we chose $ \\alpha_{ZZ} = 1.0 $, $ \\alpha_X = 0.53 $, and $ \\alpha_Z = 0.1 $, placing the model far from any integrable point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will:\n",
    "* Estimate the expected QPU runtime for full error mitigation using QESEM's analytical and empirical time estimation features.\n",
    "* Construct and simulate the 2D tilted-field Ising model circuit using hardware-inspired qubit layouts and gate layers.\n",
    "* Visualize device qubit connectivity and selected subgraphs for your experiment.\n",
    "* Demonstrate the use of [operator backpropagation (OBP)](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/qiskit-addons-obp) to reduce circuit depth. This technique trims operations from the circuit end at the cost of more operator measurements.\n",
    "* Perform unbiased error mitigation (EM) for multiple observables simultaneously using the QESEM qiskit function, comparing ideal, noisy, and mitigated results.\n",
    "* Analyze and plot the impact of error mitigation on magnetization across different circuit depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: OBP will generally return a set of possibly non-commuting observables. QESEM automatically optimizes measurement bases when target observables contain non-commuting terms. It generates candidate measurement basis sets using several heuristic algorithms and selects the set that minimizes the number of distinct bases. This means QESEM groups compatible observables into common bases to reduce the total number of measurement configurations required, improving efficiency."

    "## About QESEM\n",
    "\n",
    "QESEM is a reliable, high accuracy, characterization-based software implementing efficient, unbiased quasi-probabilistic error mitigation.\n",
    "It is designed to mitigate errors in generic quantum circuits and it is application agnostic. It has been validated across diverse hardware platforms, including utility-scale experiments on IBM Eagle and Heron devices. The QESEM workflow stages are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Device characterization - maps gate fidelities and identifies coherent errors, providing real-time calibration data. this stage ensures that mitigation leverages the highest-fidelity available operations.\n",
    "2. Noise-aware transpilation - generates and evaluates alternative qubit mappings, operation sets, and measurement bases, selecting the variant that minimizes estimated QPU runtime, with optional parallelization to accelerate data collection.\n",
    "3. Error suppression - redefines native gates, applies Pauli twirling, and optimizes pulse-level control (on\n",
    "supported platforms) to improve fidelity.\n",
    "4. Circuit characterization - builds a tailored local error model and fits it to QPU measurements to quantify residual noise.\n",
    "5. Error mitigation - constructs multi-type quasi-probabilistic decompositions and samples from them in an adaptive process that minimizes mitigation QPU time and sensitivity to hardware fluctuations, achieving high accuracies at large circuit volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on QESEM and a utility-scale experiment of this model on a 103-qubit, high-connectivity subgraph of the native heavy-hex geometry of ibm_marrakesh, you can refer to [Reliable high-accuracy error mitigation for utility-scale quantum circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10997)."
