    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum circuit compilation is a crucial step in the quantum computing workflow. It involves transforming a high-level quantum algorithm into a physical quantum circuit that adheres to the constraints of the target quantum hardware. Effective compilation can significantly impact the performance of quantum algorithms by reducing circuit depth, gate count, and execution time. This tutorial explores three distinct approaches to quantum circuit compilation in Qiskit, showcasing their strengths and applications through practical examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to teach users how to apply and evaluate three compilation methods in Qiskit: the SABRE transpiler, the AI-powered transpiler, and the Rustiq plugin. Users will learn how to use each method effectively and how to benchmark their performance across different quantum circuits. By the end of this tutorial, users will be able to choose and tailor compilation strategies based on specific optimization goals such as reducing circuit depth, minimizing gate count, or improving runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you will learn\n",
    "- **How to use the Qiskit transpiler with SABRE for layout and routing optimization.**\n",
    "- **How to leverage the AI transpiler for advanced, automated circuit optimization.**\n",
    "- **How to employ the Rustiq plugin for circuits requiring precise synthesis of operations, particularly in Hamiltonian simulation tasks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses three example circuits following the [Qiskit patterns](/docs/guides/intro-to-patterns) workflow to illustrate the performance of each compilation method. By the end of this tutorial, users will be equipped to choose the appropriate compilation strategy based on their specific requirements and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compilation methods overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Qiskit transpiler with SABRE**\n",
    "The Qiskit transpiler uses the SABRE (SWAP-based BidiREctional heuristic search) algorithm to optimize circuit layout and routing. SABRE focuses on minimizing SWAP gates and their impact on circuit depth while adhering to hardware connectivity constraints. This method is highly versatile and suitable for general-purpose circuit optimization, providing a balance between performance and computation time. To take advantage of the latest improvements in SABRE, detailed in [\\[1\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08368), you can increase the number of trials (for example, `layout_trials=400, swap_trials=400`). For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the default values for the number of trials in order to compare to Qiskit's default transpiler.  The advantages and parameter exploration of SABRE are covered in a separate [deep-dive tutorial](/docs/tutorials/transpilation-optimizations-with-sabre).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **AI transpiler**\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI-powered transpiler in Qiskit uses machine learning to predict optimal transpilation strategies by analyzing patterns in circuit structure and hardware constraints to select the best sequence of optimizations for a given input. This method is particularly effective for large-scale quantum circuits, offering a high degree of automation and adaptability to diverse problem types. In addition to general circuit optimization, the AI transpiler can be used with the `AIPauliNetworkSynthesis` pass, which targets Pauli network circuits — blocks composed of H, S, SX, CX, RX, RY, and RZ gates — and applies a reinforcement learning-based synthesis approach. For more information on the AI transpiler and its synthesis strategies, see [\\[2\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13196) and [\\[3\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14448).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Rustiq plugin**\n",
    "The Rustiq plugin introduces advanced synthesis techniques specifically for `PauliEvolutionGate` operations, which represent Pauli rotations commonly used in Trotterized dynamics. This plugin is valuable for circuits implementing Hamiltonian simulation, such as those used in quantum chemistry and physics problems, where accurate Pauli rotations are essential for simulating problem Hamiltonians effectively. Rustiq offers precise, low-depth circuit synthesis for these specialized operations. For more details about the implementation and performance of Rustiq, please refer to [\\[4\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03280).\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploring these compilation methods in depth, this tutorial provides users with the tools to enhance the performance of their quantum circuits, paving the way for more efficient and practical quantum computations."

    "On average, the AI transpiler performs better in terms of circuit depth, with a greater than 10% improvement across the full range of SU2 circuits. For gate count (circuit size) and transpilation runtime, both methods yield similar results overall.\n",

    "- For most qubit sizes, both SABRE and AI produce nearly identical results, suggesting that in many cases, both methods converge to similarly efficient solutions.\n",
    "- For certain circuit sizes, specifically at 30, 50, 70, and 90 qubits, the AI transpiler finds significantly shallower circuits than SABRE. This indicates that AI's learning-based approach is able to discover more optimal layouts or routing paths in cases where the SABRE heuristic does not.\n",

    "### Analysis of Hamiltonian circuit compilation results\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we evaluate the performance of three transpilation methods — SABRE, the AI-powered transpiler, and Rustiq — on quantum circuits constructed with `PauliEvolutionGate`, which are commonly used in Hamiltonian simulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rustiq performed best on average in terms of circuit depth**, achieving approximately 20% lower depth than SABRE. This is expected, as Rustiq is specifically designed to synthesize `PauliEvolutionGate` operations with optimized, low-depth decomposition strategies. Furthermore, the depth plot shows that as the circuits scale in size and complexity, Rustiq scales most effectively, maintaining significantly lower depth than both AI and SABRE on larger circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI transpiler showed strong and consistent performance for circuit depth, consistently outperforming SABRE across most circuits. However, it incurred the highest runtime, especially on larger circuits, which may limit its practicality in time-sensitive workloads. Its scalability in runtime remains a key limitation, even though it offers solid improvements in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "SABRE, while producing the highest average depth, achieved the lowest average gate count, closely followed by the AI transpiler. This aligns with the design of SABRE’s heuristic, which prioritizes minimizing gate count directly. Rustiq, despite its strength in lowering depth, had the highest average gate count, which is a notable trade-off to consider in applications where circuit size matters more than circuit duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "While the AI transpiler generally delivers better results than SABRE, particularly in circuit depth, the takeaway should not simply be \"always use the AI transpiler.\" There are important nuances to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AI transpiler** is typically reliable and provides depth-optimized circuits, but it comes with trade-offs in runtime, and also has other limitations, including supported coupling maps and synthesis capabilities. These are detailed in the [Qiskit Transpiler Service documentation](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/qiskit-transpiler-service).\n",
    "\n",
    "- In some cases, particularly with very large or hardware-specific circuits, the AI transpiler may not be as effective. In these cases, the default SABRE transpiler remains extremely reliable and can be further optimized by adjusting its parameters (see the [SABRE optimization tutorial](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/tutorials/transpilation-optimizations-with-sabre)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's also important to consider circuit structure when choosing a method. For example, `rustiq` is purpose-built for circuits involving `PauliEvolutionGate` and often yields the best performance for Hamiltonian simulation problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**\n",
    "> There is no one-size-fits-all transpilation strategy. Users are encouraged to understand the structure of their circuit and test multiple transpilation methods — including AI, SABRE, and specialized tools like Rustiq — to find the most efficient solution for their specific problem and hardware constraints."
