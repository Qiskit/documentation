    "## Background\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use a **Multi-Product Formula (MPF)** to achieve a lower Trotter error on our observable compared to the one incurred by the deepest Trotter circuit that we will actually execute.\n",
    "MPFs reduce the Trotter error of Hamiltonian dynamics through a weighted combination of several circuit executions. Consider the task of finding observable expectation values for the quantum state\n",
    "$\\rho(t)=e^{-i H t} \\rho(0) e^{i H t}$ with the Hamiltonian $H$. You can use Product Formulas (PFs) to approximate the time evolution $e^{-i H t}$ by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write the Hamiltonian $H$ as $H=\\sum_{a=1}^d F_a,$ where $F_a$ are Hermitian operators such that each corresponding unitary can be efficiently implemented on a quantum device.\n",
    "- Approximate the terms $F_a$ that do not commute with each other\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the $1^{st}$ order PF (Lie-Trotter formula) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_1(t):=\\prod_{a=1}^d e^{-i F_a t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which has a quadratic error term $S_1(t)=e^{-i H t}+\\mathcal{O}\\left(t^{2}\\right)$. One can also use higher-order PFs (Lie-Trotter-Suzuki formulas), which converge faster, and are defined recursively as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_2(t):=\\prod_{a=1}^d e^{-i F_a t/2}\\prod_{a=1}^d e^{-i F_a t/2}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\chi$ is the order of the symmetric PF and $s_p = \\left( 4 - 4^{1/(2p-1)} \\right)^{-1}$. For long time-evolutions, one can split the time interval $t$ into $k$ intervals, called Trotter steps, of duration $t/k$ and approximate the time-evolution in each interval with a $\\chi$ order product formula $S_{\\chi}$. Thus, the PF of order $\\chi$ for time-evolution operator over $k$ Trotter steps is:\n",

    "There is no obvious restriction on the choice of number of Trotter steps $k_j$ that make up the MPF state $\\mu(t)$. However, these must be picked carefully to avoid instabilities in the resulting expectation values calculated from $\\mu(t)$. A good general rule is to set the smallest Trotter step $k_{\\text{min}}$ so that $t/k_{\\text{min}} \\lt 1$. If you want to learn more about this and how to choose your other $k_j$ values, refer to the [How to choose the Trotter steps for an MPF](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mpf/how_tos/choose_trotter_steps.html) guide.\n",

Specifically, we compare the expectation values calculated from each of the approximate time evolutions implemented with the corresponding Trotter steps and the various MPF models (static and dynamic coefficients) with the exact values of the time-evolved observable. First, let's define the parameters for the Trotter formulas and the evolution times."

Therefore, it is possible to cancel out lower-order error terms contributing to $\\mu(t)$ with a careful choice of the weights $x_j$ of the linear combination. To cancel the Trotter error for the first $l-1$ terms (these will give the largest contributions as they correspond to the lower number of Trotter steps) in the expression for $\\mu(t)$, the coefficients $x_j$ must satisfy the following equations:\n",

    "with $n=0, ... l-2$. The first equation guarantees that there is no bias in the constructed state $\\mu(t)$, while the second equation ensures the cancellation of the Trotter errors.

The quantities $L_i(t)$ and $M_{i,j}(t)$ can be calculated efficiently using tensor network methods [\\[3\\]](#Reference3). The MPF Qiskit addon provides several \"backends\" to carry out the calculation. The example below shows the most flexible way to do so, and the [TeNPy layer-based backend](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mpf/apidocs/qiskit_addon_mpf.backends.tenpy_layers.html#module-qiskit_addon_mpf.backends.tenpy_layers) docs also explain in great detail. To use this method, start from the circuit implementing the desired time-evolution and create models that represent these operations from the layers of the corresponding circuit. Finally, an `Evolver` object is created that can be used to generate the time-evolved quantities $M_{i,j}(t)$ and $L_i(t)$. We start by creating the  `Evolver` object corresponding to the approximate time-evolution ([`ApproxEvolverFactory`](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mpf/apidocs/qiskit_addon_mpf.dynamic.html#qiskit_addon_mpf.dynamic.ApproxEvolverFactory)) implemented by the circuits. In particular, pay extra attention to the `order` variable so that they match. Note that in generating the circuits corresponding to the approximate time-evolution, we use placeholder values for the `time = 1.0` and the number of Trotter steps (`reps=1`). The correct approximating circuits are then produced by the dynamic problem solver in `setup_dynamic_lse`."

Realistically, we would approximate the exact evolution by using a higher-order Suzuki–Trotter formula or another reliable method with a small time step. Below, we approximate the exact time-evolved state with a fourth-order Suzuki-Trotter formula using a small time step `dt=0.1`, which means the number of Trotter steps used at time $t$ is $k=t/dt$. We also specify some TeNPy-specific truncation options to bound the maximum bond dimension of the underlying tensor network, as well as the minimum singular values of the split tensor network bonds. These parameters can affect the accuracy of the expectation value calculated with the dynamic MPF coefficients, so it is important to explore a range of values to find the optimal balance between computational time and accuracy. Note that the calculation of the MPF coefficients does not rely of the expectation value of the PF obtained from hardware execution, and therefore it can be tuned in post-processing."

    "In the cases like the example above, where the $k=1$ PF behaves poorly at all times, the quality of the dynamic MPF results is also heavily affected. In such situations, it is useful to investigate the possibility of using individual PFs with higher number of Trotter steps to improve the overall quality of the results. In these simulations, we see the interplay of different types of errors: error from finite sampling and Trotter error from the product formulas. MPF helps to reduce the Trotter error due to the product formulas but incur in higher sampling error compared to the product formulas. This can be advantageous as product formulas can reduce the sampling error with increased sampling but the systematic error due to the Trotter approximation remains untouched.\n",
    "Another interesting behavior that we can observe from the plot is that the expectation value for the PF for $k=1$ starts to behave erratically (on top of not being a good approximation for the exact one) at times for which $t/k > 1 $, as explained in the [guide](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mpf/how_tos/choose_trotter_steps.html) on how to choose the number of Trotter step."

    "In the example above, the dynamic MPF method performs best in terms of expectation value, improving over what one would have obtained by using the highest number of Trotter steps alone. Even though the various MPF techniques are not always achieving an improved expectation value compared to the highest number of Trotter steps (like the exact and the approximate model in the plot above), the standard deviation of these values capture well the increased variance incurred when using the MPF technique. This highlights uncertainty around the obtained expectation value, which always includes the expectation value one would expect from an exact time-evolution of the system. On the other hand, the expectation values calculated with the lower number of Trotter steps fails to even capture the exact expectation value within their uncertainty, thus confidently returning the wrong result."

    "#### Choosing Trotter steps\n",
    "The experiment showcased in Fig. 4 of Ref. [\\[3\\]](#Reference3) uses $k_j = [2, 3, 4]$ symmetric Trotter steps of order $2$. We focus on the results for time $t=3$, where the MPF and a PF with higher number of Trotter steps (6 in this case) have the same Trotter error. However, the MPF expectation value is calculated from circuits corresponding to lower number of Trotter steps and thus shallower. In practice, even if the MPF and the deeper Trotter steps circuit have the same Trotter error, we expect the experimental expectation value calculated from the MPF circuits to be closer to the theory one as it entails running shallower circuits less exposed to hardware noise compared to the circuit corresponding wo the higher Trotter step PF."

    "When executing circuits on hardware we may encounter additional challenges in obtaining accurate expectation values due to the presence of hardware noise. This is not accounted for in the MPF formalism and could play against the MPF solution. For example, this could be the reason for the failure of the dynamic coefficients to provide a better estimate of the expectation value compared to the approximate static coefficient in the plot. That is, the approximate evolver, which simulates the approximate circuit, does not accurately reflect the results obtained by executing the approximate circuits in the presence of hardware noise. For these reasons, it is recommended to combine different error mitigation techniques in order to get results as close as possible to the ideal values for each of the product formulas. This will show consistent benefits from the MPF approach.\n",
    "Overall, the approximate static coefficients still give a more accurate solution than the product formula with higher number of Trotter steps with the same amount of Trotter error in the noiseless setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that in this example which reproduces the experiment in Ref.  [\\[3\\]](#Reference3), the time point $t=3$ is beyond the limit at which it is expected that the PF with $k=2$ behaves well, that is $t/k>1$ as discussed in this [guide](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mpf/how_tos/choose_trotter_steps.html)."
