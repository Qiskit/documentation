    "## Background\n",
    "Transpilation is a critical step in Qiskit that converts quantum circuits into forms compatible with specific quantum hardware. It involves two key stages: **qubit layout** (mapping logical qubits to physical qubits on the device) and **gate routing** (ensuring multi-qubit gates respect device connectivity by inserting SWAP gates as needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "SABRE (*SWAP-Based Bidirectional heuristic search algorithm*) is a powerful optimization tool for both layout and routing. It is especially effective for **large-scale circuits** (100+ qubits) and devices with complex coupling maps, like the **IBM Heron**, where the exponential growth in possible qubit mappings demands efficient solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use SABRE?\n",
    "\n",
    "SABRE minimizes the number of SWAP gates and reduces circuit depth, improving circuit performance on real hardware. Its heuristic-based approach makes it ideal for advanced hardware and large, complex circuits. Recent improvements introduced in the [LightSABRE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08368) algorithm further optimize SABRE’s performance, offering faster runtimes and fewer SWAP gates. These enhancements make it even more effective for large-scale circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you’ll learn\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into two parts:\n",
    "1. Learn to use SABRE with **Qiskit Patterns** for advanced optimization of large circuits.\n",
    "2. Leverage **qiskit_serverless** to maximize SABRE’s potential for scalable and efficient transpilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "- Optimize SABRE for circuits with 100+ qubits, surpassing default transpilation settings like `optimization_level=3`.\n",
    "- Explore **LightSABRE enhancements** that improve runtime and reduce gate counts.\n",
    "- Customize key SABRE parameters (`swap_trials`, `layout_trials`, `max_iterations`, `heuristic`) to balance **circuit quality** and **transpilation runtime**."

    "\n",
    "SABRE can be used in Qiskit to optimize quantum circuits by handling both the qubit layout and gate routing stages. In this section, we’ll guide you through the **minimal example** of using SABRE with Qiskit patterns, with the primary focus on step 2 of optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run SABRE, you need:\n",
    "- A **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) representation of your quantum circuit.\n",
    "- The **coupling map** from the backend, which specifies how qubits are physically connected.\n",
    "- The **SABRE pass**, which applies the algorithm to optimize the layout and routing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part, we’ll focus on the **SabreLayout** pass. It performs both layout and routing trials, working to find the most efficient initial layout while minimizing the number of SWAP gates needed. Importantly, `SabreLayout`, just by itself, internally optimizes both the layout and routing by storing the solution that adds the least number of SWAP gates. Note that when using just **SabreLayout**, we cannot change the heuristic of SABRE, but we are able to customize the number of `layout_trials`."

    "\n",
    "A **GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger)** circuit is a quantum circuit that prepares an entangled state where all qubits are either in the `|0...0⟩` or `|1...1⟩` state. The GHZ state for $n$ qubits is mathematically represented as:\n",
    "$$ |\\text{GHZ}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( |0\\rangle^{\\otimes n} + |1\\rangle^{\\otimes n} \\right) $$\n",

    "1. A Hadamard gate to the first qubit to create superposition.\n",
    "2. A series of CNOT gates to entangle the remaining qubits with the first.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we intentionally construct a **star-topology GHZ circuit** instead of a linear-topology one. In the star topology, the first qubit acts as the \"hub,\" and all other qubits are entangled directly with it using CNOT gates. This choice is deliberate because, while the **linear topology GHZ state** can theoretically be implemented in $ O(N) $ depth on a linear coupling map without any SWAP gates, SABRE would trivially find an optimal solution by mapping a 100-qubit GHZ circuit to a subgraph of the backend's heavy-hex coupling map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **star topology GHZ circuit** poses a significantly more challenging problem. Although it can still theoretically be executed in $ O(N) $ depth without SWAP gates, finding this solution requires identifying an optimal initial layout, which is much harder due to the non-linear connectivity of the circuit. This topology serves as a better test case for evaluating SABRE, as it demonstrates how configuration parameters impact layout and routing performance under more complex conditions.\n",

    "- The **HighLevelSynthesis** tool can produce the optimal $ O(N) $ depth solution for the star topology GHZ circuit without introducing SWAP gates, like shown in the image above.\n",
    "- Alternatively, the **StarPrerouting** pass can reduce the depth further by guiding SABRE's routing decisions, though it may still introduce some SWAP gates. However, StarPrerouting increases runtime and requires integration into the initial transpilation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this notebook, we exclude both HighLevelSynthesis and StarPrerouting to isolate and highlight the direct impact of SABRE configuration on runtime and circuit depth. By measuring the expectation value $ \\langle Z_0 Z_i \\rangle $ for each qubit pair, we analyze:\n",

    "## Part II. Configuring the heuristic in SABRE and using Serverless\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to adjusting trial numbers, SABRE allows customization of the routing heuristic used during transpilation. By default, `SabreLayout` employs the decay heuristic, which dynamically weights qubits based on their likelihood of being swapped. To use a different heuristic (such as the `lookahead` heuristic), you can create a custom `SabreSwap` pass and connect it to `SabreLayout` by running a `PassManager` with `FullAncillaAllocation`, `EnlargeWithAncilla`, and `ApplyLayout`. When using `SabreSwap` as a parameter for `SabreLayout`, only one layout trial is performed by default. To efficiently run multiple layout trials, we leverage the serverless runtime for parallelization. For more about serverless, see the [Serverless documentation](/docs/guides/serverless).\n",

    "These results demonstrate the significant efficiency of serverless execution in quantum circuit transpilation. For 200 layout trials, serverless reduced the runtime by over 60% for both the `decay` and `lookahead` heuristics compared to serial execution. The total transpilation time for `decay` (443.29 s) and `lookahead` (400.65 s) highlights the computational effort required for serial execution, while the serverless job times (157.97 s and 158.12 s, respectively) showcase the dramatic runtime reduction achieved through parallelization. These findings emphasize that serverless execution can effectively scale to larger problems, offering substantial time savings and enabling broader exploration of optimization trials with minimal overhead."

    "Each point in the scatter plots above represents a layout trial, with the x-axis indicating the circuit depth and the y-axis indicating the circuit size. The results reveal that the lookahead heuristic generally outperforms the decay heuristic in minimizing circuit depth and circuit size. In practical applications, the goal is to identify the optimal layout trial for your chosen heuristic, whether prioritizing depth or size. This can be achieved by selecting the trial with the lowest value for the desired metric. Importantly, increasing the number of layout trials improves the chances of achieving a better result in terms of size or depth, but it comes at the cost of higher computational overhead."

    "In our initial comparison of heuristics using a single layout trial, the lookahead heuristic yielded the best result with a depth of 389 and size of 3384. By leveraging multiple trials through `QiskitServerless`, we explored various layout options for each heuristic, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation. Interestingly, the `decay` heuristic outperformed the `lookahead` heuristic in some cases, achieving a minimum depth of 355 and a minimum size of 3221 across the trials. However, the lookahead heuristic ultimately delivered the best overall results, with a minimum depth of 314 and a minimum size of 2829. This represents a significant improvement over its single-trial performance, highlighting the advantages of using serverless runtime for multi-trial optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings underscore the importance of experimenting with different heuristics and tailoring them to specific scenarios. By systematically comparing performance across multiple trials, we can identify the heuristic that delivers the optimal trade-off between depth and size for a given problem. This approach ensures more robust and efficient quantum circuit transpilation."

    "In this tutorial, we explored how to optimize large circuits using SABRE in Qiskit. We demonstrated how to configure the `SabreLayout` pass with different parameters to balance circuit quality and transpilation runtime. We also showed how to customize the routing heuristic in SABRE and use the `QiskitServerless`runtime to parallelize layout trials efficiently for when `SabreSwap` is involved. By adjusting these parameters and heuristics, you can optimize the layout and routing of large circuits, ensuring they are executed efficiently on quantum hardware."
