    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates a hybrid quantum–classical workflow that enhances a classical ensemble with a quantum optimization step. Using Multiverse Computing’s “Singularity Machine Learning – Classification” (a Qiskit Function), we train a pool of conventional learners (for example, decision trees, k-NN, logistic regression) and then refine that pool with a quantum layer to improve diversity and generalization. The objective is practical: on a real grid-stability prediction task, we compare a strong classical baseline with a quantum-optimized alternative under the same data splits, so you can see where the quantum step helps and what it costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this matters: selecting a good subset from many weak learners is a combinatorial problem that grows quickly with ensemble size. Classical heuristics like boosting, bagging, and stacking perform well at moderate scales but can struggle to explore large, redundant libraries of models efficiently. The function integrates quantum algorithms - specifically QAOA (and optionally VQE in other configurations) - to search that space more effectively after the classical learners are trained, increasing the chance of finding a compact, diverse subset that generalizes better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, data scale is not limited by qubits. The heavy lifting on data — preprocessing, training the learner pool, and evaluation — remains classical and can handle millions of examples. Qubits only determine the ensemble size used in the quantum selection step. This decoupling is what makes the approach viable on today’s hardware: you keep familiar scikit-learn workflows for data and model training while calling the quantum step through a clean action interface in Qiskit Functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, while different learner types can be provided to the ensemble (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression, or k-NN), Decision Trees tend to perform best. The optimizer consistently favors stronger ensemble members—when heterogeneous learners are supplied, weaker models such as linear regressors are typically pruned in favor of more expressive ones like Decision Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you will do here: prepare and balance the grid-stability dataset; establish a classical AdaBoost baseline; run several quantum configurations that vary ensemble width and regularization; execute on IBM&reg; simulators or QPUs via Qiskit Serverless; and compare accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 across all runs. Along the way, you will use the function’s action pattern (`create`, `fit`, `predict`, `fit_predict`, `create_fit_predict`) and key controls:\n",
    "- Regularization types: `onsite` (λ) for direct sparsity and `alpha` for a ratio-based trade-off between interaction and onsite terms\n",
    "- Auto-regularization: set `regularization=\"auto\"` with a target selection ratio to adapt sparsity automatically\n",
    "- Optimizer options: simulator versus QPU, repetitions, classical optimizer and its options, transpilation depth, and runtime sampler/estimator settings\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarks in the documentation show that accuracy improves as the number of learners (qubits) increases on challenging problems, with the quantum classifier matching or exceeding a comparable classical ensemble. In this tutorial, you will reproduce the workflow end-to-end and examine when increasing ensemble width or switching to adaptive regularization yields better F1 at reasonable resource usage. The result is a grounded view of how a quantum optimization step can complement, rather than replace, classical ensemble learning in real applications."

    "\n",
    "We now post-process outputs from both the classical and quantum runs, converting them into a consistent format for downstream evaluation. This step compares predictive quality using standard metrics - accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 - and analyzes how ensemble width (`num_learners`) and sparsity control (`regularization`) influence both performance and computational behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical AdaBoost baseline provides a compact and stable reference for small-scale learning. It performs well with limited ensembles and negligible compute overhead, reflecting the strength of traditional boosting when the hypothesis space is still tractable. The quantum configurations (`qeec_pred_job_1`, `qeec_pred_job_2`, and `qeec_pred_job_3`) extend this baseline by embedding the ensemble-selection process within a variational quantum optimization loop. This allows the system to explore exponentially large subsets of learners simultaneously in superposition, addressing the combinatorial nature of ensemble selection more efficiently as scale increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results show that increasing `num_learners` from 10 to 30 improves recall and F1, confirming that a wider ensemble captures richer interactions among weak learners. The gain is sublinear on current hardware - each additional learner yields smaller accuracy increments - but the underlying scaling behavior remains favorable because the quantum optimizer can search broader configuration spaces without the exponential blow-up typical of classical subset selection. Regularization introduces additional nuance: a fixed λ=7 enforces consistent sparsity and stabilizes convergence, whereas adaptive α-regularization automatically tunes sparsity based on correlations between learners. This dynamic pruning often achieves slightly higher F1 for the same qubit width, balancing model complexity and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "When compared directly with the AdaBoost baseline, the smallest quantum configuration (L=10) reproduces similar accuracy, validating the hybrid pipeline’s correctness. At larger widths, quantum variants - especially with auto-regularization - begin to surpass the classical baseline modestly, showing improved recall and F1 without linear growth in computational cost. These improvements do not indicate immediate \"quantum advantage\" but rather **scaling efficiency**: the quantum optimizer maintains tractable performance as the ensemble expands, where a classical approach would face exponential growth in subset-selection complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "- Use the **classical baseline** for quick validation and benchmarking on small datasets.\n",
    "- Apply **quantum ensembles** when model width or feature complexity grows—QAOA-based search scales more gracefully in those regimes.\n",
    "- Employ **adaptive α-regularization** to maintain sparsity and generalization without increasing circuit width.\n",
    "- Monitor QPU time and depth to balance quality gains against near-term hardware constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these experiments show that quantum-optimized ensembles complement classical methods: they reproduce baseline accuracy at small scales while offering a path to efficient scaling on larger, combinatorial learning problems. As hardware improves, these scaling advantages are expected to compound, extending the feasible size and depth of ensemble-based models beyond what is classically practical."

    "The grouped bar chart below compares **Accuracy** and **F1** across the classical baseline and the quantum ensembles (`L=10`, `L=30`, and `L=60 auto-α`). It illustrates how accuracy stabilizes while F1 gradually improves as quantum ensemble width increases, demonstrating that the hybrid method sustains performance scaling without the exponential cost growth typical of classical subset selection."

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot confirms the expected scaling pattern. The classical AdaBoost performs strongly for smaller ensembles but becomes increasingly costly to scale as the number of weak learners grows, because its subset-selection problem expands combinatorially. The quantum-enhanced models replicate classical accuracy at low widths and begin to surpass it as ensemble size increases, especially under adaptive α-regularization. This reflects the quantum optimizer’s ability to sample and evaluate many candidate subsets in parallel through superposition, maintaining tractable search even at higher widths. While current hardware overhead offsets some of the theoretical gains, the trend illustrates the scaling efficiency advantage of the quantum formulation. In practical terms, the classical method remains preferable for lightweight benchmarks, while quantum-enhanced ensembles become advantageous as model dimensionality and ensemble size expand, offering better trade-offs between accuracy, generalization, and computational growth."

    "## Appendix: Scaling benefits and enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "The scalability advantage of the `QuantumEnhancedEnsembleClassifier` arises from how the ensemble-selection process maps to quantum optimization.  \n",
    "Classical ensemble learning methods, such as AdaBoost or random forests, become computationally expensive as the number of weak learners increases because selecting the optimal subset is a combinatorial problem that scales exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the quantum formulation — implemented here via the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) — can explore these exponentially large search spaces more efficiently by evaluating multiple configurations in superposition.  \n",
    "As a result, the training time does not grow significantly with the number of learners, allowing the model to remain efficient even as ensemble width increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "While current hardware introduces some noise and depth limitations, this workflow demonstrates a near-term hybrid approach where classical and quantum components cooperate: the quantum optimizer provides a better initialization landscape for the classical loop, improving convergence and final model quality.  \n",
    "As quantum processors evolve, these scalability benefits are expected to extend to larger datasets, broader ensembles, and deeper circuit depths."
