    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces a hybrid quantum–classical workflow designed to demonstrate how quantum optimization can enhance ensemble learning performance in real-world machine learning tasks. Using the *Singularity Machine Learning – Classification* function by Multiverse Computing, users will perform a complete end-to-end workflow for grid stability prediction, comparing classical ensemble baselines against a quantum-optimized alternative. The underlying technology combines classical ensemble techniques such as boosting and bagging with quantum algorithms like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which optimizes the diversity and generalization of the trained ensemble. Unlike traditional quantum models limited by the number of qubits or dataset size, this function allows large-scale datasets with millions of examples to be processed efficiently, as the number of qubits only constrains the ensemble size. Through Qiskit Serverless, this tutorial shows how to connect, configure, and execute these hybrid workflows seamlessly on IBM’s managed quantum infrastructure—either through simulators or real QPUs—giving users both practical experience and an understanding of where quantum optimization can provide measurable benefits in classical learning pipelines."

    "\n",
    "The ensemble selection task is cast as a combinatorial optimization problem where each weak learner is a binary decision variable and the objective balances accuracy with sparsity through a regularization term. The `QuantumEnhancedEnsembleClassifier` solves this with QAOA on IBM hardware, while still allowing simulator-based exploration. In this tutorial we configure a realistic production profile that scales to larger ensembles: we use 75 learners to mirror a strong classical baseline, set the regularization to favor compact yet accurate ensembles, and select a QAOA configuration that converges reliably within a practical time budget. The `optimizer_options` control the hybrid loop: `simulator=False` routes circuits to the selected QPU, `num_solutions` increases search breadth, and `classical_optimizer_options` (for the inner classical optimizer) govern convergence; values around 60 iterations are a good balance for quality and runtime. Runtime options such as moderate circuit depth (`reps`) and a standard transpilation effort help ensure robust performance across devices. The configuration below is the “best-results” profile we will use for hardware runs; you may also create a purely simulated variant by toggling `simulator=True` to dry-run the workflow without consuming QPU time."

The job returns predictions together with status and message fields that confirm successful execution. For convenience and reproducibility, we keep the classical train/validation split from Step 1 and pass the validation data into `fit_params` so the quantum optimization can use it internally for model selection without touching the held-out test set.

We compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 for the classical baseline and the quantum-enhanced ensemble on the same held-out test set, assemble the results into a small table for easy inspection, and render a simple bar chart comparing F1 scores. This concise post-processing highlights task-level differences without exposing the validation split, ensuring a clean, reproducible comparison between classical and quantum optimization paths."

    "## Appendix: Scaling Benefits and Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "The scalability advantage of the `QuantumEnhancedEnsembleClassifier` arises from how the ensemble-selection process maps to quantum optimization.\n",
    "Classical ensemble learning methods, such as AdaBoost or random forests, become computationally expensive as the number of weak learners increases because selecting the optimal subset is a combinatorial problem that scales exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the quantum formulation—implemented here via the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)—can explore these exponentially large search spaces more efficiently by evaluating multiple configurations in superposition.\n",
    "As a result, the training time grows with the number of learners, allowing the model to remain efficient even at larger ensemble scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "While current hardware introduces some noise and depth limitations, this workflow demonstrates a near-term hybrid approach where classical and quantum components cooperate: the quantum optimizer provides a better initialization landscape for the classical loop, improving both convergence and final model accuracy.\n",
    "As quantum processors evolve, these scaling benefits are expected to extend to larger datasets, more learners, and deeper circuit depths."
