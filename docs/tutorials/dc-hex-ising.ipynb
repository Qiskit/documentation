    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates the main dynamic circuit implementation to simulate the same Trotterized time evolution. Note that the honeycomb lattice we want to simulate does not match the heavy lattice of the hardware qubits. One straightforward way to map the circuit to the hardware is to introduce a series of SWAP operations to bring interacting qubits next to each other, to realize the ZZ interaction. Here we highlight an alternative approach using dynamic circuits as a solution, which illustrates that we can use the combination of quantum and real-time classical computation within a circuit in Qiskit to realize interactions beyond nearest-neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dynamic circuit implementation, the ZZ interaction is effectively implemented by using ancilla qubits, mid-circuit measurement, and feedforward. To understand this, note that the ZZ rotations apply a phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$ to the state based on its parity. For two qubits, the computational basis states are $|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$, and $|11\\rangle$. The ZZ rotation gate applies a phase factor to states $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$ whose parity (the number of ones in the state) is odd and leaves even-parity states unchanged. The following describes how we can effectively implement ZZ interactions on two qubits using dynamic circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute parity into an ancilla qubit: instead of directly applying ZZ to two qubits, we introduce a third qubit, the ancilla qubit, to store the parity information of the two data qubits. We entangle the ancilla with each data qubit using CX gates from the data qubit to the ancilla qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply a single-qubit Z rotation to the ancilla qubit: this is because the ancilla has the parity information of the two data qubits, which effectively implements the ZZ rotation on the data qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Measure the ancilla qubit in the X basis: this is the key step that collapses the state of the ancilla qubit, and the measurement outcome tells us what has happened:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Measure 0: when a 0 outcome is observed, we have in fact correctly applied a $ZZ(\\theta)$ rotation to our data qubits.\n",

    "    * Measure 1: when a 1 outcome is observed, We've applied $ZZ(\\theta + \\pi)$ instead.\n",
    "\n",

    "One caveat of using the dynamic circuit implementation to realize the ZZ interaction is that the mid-circuit measurement and the classical feedforward operations typically take a longer time to execute than quantum gates. To suppress qubit decoherence during the idling time for the classical operations to happen, we added a [dynamical decoupling](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#dynamical-decoupling) (DD) sequence after the measurement operation on the ancilla qubits, and before the conditional Z operation on the data qubit, before the `if_test` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DD sequence is added by the function `add_stretch_dd()`, which uses the [`stretch` durations](/docs/guides/stretch) to determine the time intervals between the DD gates. A `stretch` duration is a way to specify a stretchable time duration for the `delay` operation such that the delay duration can grow to fill up the qubit idling time. The duration variables specified by `stretch` are resolved at compile time into desired durations that satisfy a certain constraint. This is very useful when the timing of DD sequences is essential to achieve good error suppression performance. For more details on the `stretch` type, see the [OpenQASM](https://openqasm.com/language/delays.html#duration-and-stretch-types) documentation. Currently, support for the `stretch` type in Qiskit Runtime is experimental. For details on its usage constraints, please refer to [the limitations section](/docs/guides/stretch#qiskit-runtime-limitations) of the `stretch` documentation.\n",

The `MidCircuitMeasure` instruction maps to the `measure_2` instruction supported by the backends. Note that `measure_2` is not supported on all backends. You can use `service.backends(filters=lambda b: \"measure_2\" in b.supported_instructions)` to find backends that support it. Here, we show how to transpile the circuit so that the mid-circuit measurements defined in the circuit are executed using the `MidCircuitMeasure` operation, if the backend supports it.\n",

    "The main benefit of the measurement-based circuit is that, when implementing multiple ZZ interactions, the CX layers can be parallelized, and measurements can occur simultaneously. This is because all ZZ interactions commute, so the computation can be performed with measurement depth 1. After transpiling the circuits, we observe that the dynamic circuit approach yields a significantly shorter two-qubit depth than the standard unitary approach, with the caveat that the additional mid-circuit measurement and the classical feedforward themselves take time and introduce their own sources of errors."

In summary, we present dynamic circuits as a solution for simulating Ising spin models on a honeycomb lattice, a topology that is not native to the hardware. The dynamic circuit solution allows ZZ interactions between qubits that are not nearest neighbors, with a shorter two-qubit gate depth than using SWAP gates, at the cost of introducing extra ancilla qubits and classical feedforward operations."
