    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to use sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) to estimate the ground state energy of a fermionic lattice model. Specifically, we study the one-dimensional single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM), which is used to describe magnetic impurities embedded in metals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial follows a similar workflow to the related tutorial [Sample-based quantum diagonalization of a chemistry Hamiltonian](/docs/tutorials/sample-based-quantum-diagonalization). However, a key difference lies in how the quantum circuits are built. The other tutorial uses a heuristic variational ansatz, which is appealing for chemistry Hamiltonians with potentially millions of interaction terms. On the other hand, this tutorial uses circuits that approximate time evolution by the Hamiltonian. Such circuits can be deep, which makes this approach better for applications to lattice models. The state vectors prepared by these circuits form the basis for a [Krylov subspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krylov_subspace), and as a result, the algorithm provably and efficiently converges to the ground state, under suitable assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach used in this tutorial can be viewed as a combination of the techniques used in SQD and [Krylov quantum diagonalization (KQD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14431). The combined approach is sometimes referred to as sample-based Krylov quantum diagonalization (SQKD). See [Krylov quantum diagonalization of lattice Hamiltonians](/docs/tutorials/krylov-quantum-diagonalization) for a tutorial on the KQD method.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on the work [\"Quantum-Centric Algorithm for Sample-Based Krylov Diagonalization\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09702), which can be referred to for more details.\n",

    "Due to the approximate translational symmetry in $H_\\textrm{bath}$, we don't expect the ground state to be sparse in the position basis (the orbital basis in which the Hamiltonian is specified above). The performance of SQD is guaranteed only if the ground state is sparse, that is, it has significant weight on only a small number of computational basis states. To improve the sparsity of the ground state, we perform the simulation in the orbital basis in which $H_\\textrm{bath}$ is diagonal. We call this basis the *momentum basis*. Because $H_\\textrm{bath}$ is a quadratic fermionic Hamiltonian, it can be efficiently diagonalized by an orbital rotation.\n",

    "Under the [Jordan-Wigner transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93Wigner_transformation), time evolution by $H_2$ amounts to a single [CPhase](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CPhaseGate) gate between the spin-up and spin-down orbitals at the impurity site. Because $H_1$ is a quadratic fermionic Hamiltonian, time evolution by $H_1$ amounts to an orbital rotation.\n",
