    "This walkthrough explores the error suppression and error mitigation options available with the Estimator primitive from Qiskit Runtime. You will construct a circuit and observable and submit jobs using the Estimator primitive using different combinations of error mitigation settings. Then, you will plot the results to observe the effects of the various settings. Most of the examples use a 10-qubit circuit to make visualizations easier, and at the end, you can scale up the workflow to 50 qubits.\n",

    "This walkthrough assumes that the classical problem has already been mapped to quantum. Begin by constructing a circuit and observable to measure.

It's built by alternating layers of parameterized single-qubit gates with a layer containing a fixed pattern of two-qubit gates, for a chosen number of repetitions. The pattern of two-qubit gates can be specified by the user. Here you can use the built-in `pairwise` pattern because it minimizes the circuit depth by packing the two-qubit gates as densely as possible. This pattern can be executed using only linear qubit connectivity."

    "When you compare the 50-qubit results with the 10-qubit results from earlier, you might note the following (your results might differ across runs):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The results without error mitigation are worse. Running the larger circuit involves executing more gates, so there are more opportunities for errors to accumulate.\n",
    "- The addition of dynamical decoupling might have worsened performance. This is not surprising, because the circuit is very dense. Dynamical decoupling is primarily useful when there are large gaps in the circuit during which qubits sit idle without gates being applied to them. When these gaps are not present, dynamical decoupling is not effective, and can actually worsen performance due to errors in the dynamical decoupling pulses themselves. The 10-qubit circuit may have been too small for us to observe this effect.\n",
    "- With zero-noise extrapolation, the result is as good, or nearly as good, as the 10-qubit result, though the error bar is much larger. This demonstrates the power of the ZNE technique!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, you investigated different error mitigation options available for the Qiskit Runtime Estimator primitive. You developed a workflow using a 10-qubit circuit, and then scaled it up to 50 qubits. You might have observed that enabling more error suppression and mitigation options doesn't always improve performance (specifically, enabling dynamical decoupling in this case). Most of the options accept additional configuration, which you can test out in your own work!"
