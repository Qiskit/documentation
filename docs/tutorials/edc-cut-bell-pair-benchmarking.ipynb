    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum hardware is typically limited to local interactions, but many algorithms require entangling distant qubits or even [qubits on separate processors](#references). Dynamic circuits, that is, circuits with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward, provide a way to overcome these limitations by using real-time classical communication to effectively implement non-local quantum operations. In this approach, measurement outcomes from one part of a circuit (or one QPU) can conditionally trigger gates on another, allowing us to teleport entanglement across long distances. This forms the basis of **local operations and classical communication (LOCC)** schemes, where we consume entangled resource states (Bell pairs) and communicate measurement results classically to link distant qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "One promising use of LOCC is to realize virtual long-range CNOT gates by teleportation, as shown in the [long-range entanglement tutorial](/docs/tutorials/long-range-entanglement). Instead of a direct long-range CNOT (which hardware connectivity might not permit), we create Bell pairs and perform a teleportation-based gate implementation. However, the fidelity of such operations depends on hardware characteristics. Qubit decoherence during the necessary delay (while waiting for measurement results) and classical communication latency can degrade the entangled state. Also, errors on mid-circuit measurements are harder to correct than errors on final measurements as they propagate to the rest of the circuit through the conditional gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [reference experiment](#references), the authors introduce a Bell pair fidelity benchmark to identify which parts of a device are best suited for LOCC-based entanglement. The idea is to run a small dynamic circuit on every group of four connected qubits in the processor. This four-qubit circuit first creates a Bell pair on two middle qubits, then uses those as a resource to entangle the two edge qubits by using LOCC. Concretely, qubits 1 and 2 are prepared into an uncut Bell pair locally (using a Hadamard and CNOT), and then a teleportation routine consumes that Bell pair to entangle qubits 0 and 3. Qubits 1 and 2 are measured during execution of the circuit, and based on those outcomes, Pauli corrections (an X on qubit 3 and Z on qubit 0) are applied. Qubits 0 and 3 are then left in a Bell state at the end of the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the quality of this final entangled pair, we measure its stabilizers: specifically, the parity in the $Z$ basis ($Z_0Z_3$) and in the $X$ basis ($X_0X_3$). For a perfect Bell pair, both of these expectations equal +1. In practice, hardware noise will reduce these values. We therefore repeat the circuit twice for each qubit-pair: one circuit measures qubits 0 and 3 in the $Z$ basis, and another measures them in the $X$ basis. From the results, we obtain an estimate of $\\langle Z_0Z_3\\rangle$ and $\\langle X_0X_3\\rangle$ for that pair of qubits. We use the mean squared error (MSE) of these stabilizers with respect to the ideal value (1) as a simple metric of entanglement fidelity. A lower MSE means the two qubits achieved a Bell state closer to ideal (higher fidelity), whereas a higher MSE indicates more error. By scanning this experiment across the device, we can benchmark the measurement-and-feedforward capability of different qubit groups and identify the best pairs of qubits for LOCC operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the experiment on an IBM Quantum device to illustrate how dynamic circuits can be used to generate and evaluate entanglement between distant qubits. We will map out all 4-qubit linear chains on the device, run the teleportation circuit on each, and then visualize the distribution of MSE values. This end-to-end procedure shows how to leverage Qiskit Runtime and dynamic circuit features to inform hardware-aware choices for cutting circuits or distributing quantum algorithms across a modular system."

Bundling allows us to run multiple 4-qubit experiments in parallel on distinct parts of the chip and make efficient use of the whole device.

These conditional gates (realized using Qiskit’s `if_test`/`if_else` construct) implement the standard teleportation corrections.

Transpilation will map the abstract circuit onto the physical qubits and gate set of the chosen device. Since we have already chosen specific physical qubits for each chain (by providing an `initial_layout` to the circuit generator), we use transpiler `optimization_level=0` with that fixed layout. This tells Qiskit not to reassign qubits or perform any heavy optimizations that could alter the circuit structure.

Factors like qubit readout error, qubit lifetime, and crosstalk likely contribute to these differences.

    "Finally, we visualize the overall performance by plotting the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the MSE values for all chains. The CDF plot shows on the x-axis the MSE threshold and on the y-axis the fraction of qubit pairs that have at most that MSE. This curve starts at zero and approaches 1 as the threshold grows to encompass all data points. A steep rise near low MSE would indicate many pairs are high-fidelity; a slow rise means many pairs have larger error. We annotate the CDF with the identities of the best pairs. In the plot, each point in the CDF corresponds to one 4-qubit chain’s MSE, and we label the point with the pair of qubit indices $[q0, q3]$ that were entangled in that experiment. This makes it easy to spot which physical qubit pairs are the top performers (the far-left points on the CDF)."
