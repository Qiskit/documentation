# Migrate to the upgraded IBM Quantum Platform

This guide describes how, why, and when to transition to the [new version of IBM Quantum Platform.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/)

<Admonition type="note" title="Users with email invitations for their organization's account">
If you have been invited by your organization to join an account:
- Be sure you have accepted the invitation you received by email, and have created your user ID on IBM Cloud. (If you already have an IBM Cloud account associated with the invited email address, there is no need to create a new user ID.)

- You have already been added to an instance in your organization's account, so your next step is to [find your access credentials](/docs/guides/initialize-account#access-credentials), as detailed in the "Set up your IBM Cloud account" guide.

- If you have not yet installed Qiskit, start with the [Introduction to Qiskit](/docs/guides) guide.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="New users">
If you are a new user, ignore this guide and start with the [Introduction to Qiskit](/docs/guides/index) guide.
</Admonition>

Find the recent changes to the new platform on the [Latest updates page,](/docs/guides/latest-updates) which is updated regularly.

## When should I make the transition?

Open and Pay-As-You-Go Plan users are encouraged to create an account and start using the new platform as soon as possible.

Premium Plan, On-Prem Plan, and Startup Program users should not create a new account yet and should wait to receive migration guidance from their administrators in the coming weeks.

## Benefits

The new version of IBM Quantum Platform is very similar to the current interface, but provides the flexibility to add features that would be difficult or impossible to deploy with the classic platform. Examples include enhanced data privacy and security, a streamlined notifications experience, and multiple language options.

## Major differences

There are a few major changes you will see in the updated IBM Quantum Platform:

* For Open Plan users, there is no longer a limit to the number of jobs you can have in the queue.
* Open Plan users cannot run session jobs.  Previously, if you tried to run a job in a session, it was run in job mode.  Now, if you try to run a job in a session, the job fails.  Instead, Open Plan users should explicitly write their code to run in job or batch mode. See [execution modes](/docs/guides/execution-modes) to learn how to set the execution mode.
* Quantum computers powered by the state-of-the-art IBM Quantum Heron processor are available through the Open Plan.
* For IBM Quantum Platform Classic users, the hierarchical authorization structure has changed.  That is, there are no hubs, groups, or projects in the new platform. All user management is done through IBM Cloud [identity and access management (IAM)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverview). By default, access groups are created for you when you create an instance through the IBM Quantum Platform user interface.
* When activating the service, the IBM Cloud Instance CRN or name can optionally be passed in (the CRN is required in `qiskit-ibm-runtime versions earlier than v0.40.0`), and the channel must be set to `ibm_cloud` or `ibm_quantum_platform`. Both of these channels point to the new IBM Quantum Platform API but the `ibm_cloud` channel will be deprecated and removed in a future release. The instance is specified by using its cloud resource name (CRN).

### Instances

_Instances_ are virtual servers that manage your workload execution, including executing quantum programs and classical compute tasks (such as processing error mitigation).  Instances are specified by their Cloud Resource Name (CRN).

You can see the instances you have access to on the dashboard or by clicking the Instances tab from the dashboard. Each instance is listed with its CRN identifier. You can include this identifier or the name of the instance when connecting to Qiskit Runtime by using the `QiskitRuntimeService` object when using `qiskit-ibm-runtime` in a Python environment. When an instance is passed in, only backends and jobs from that instance are available. Alternatively, if an instance is not included, then all backends and jobs across all instances in your account are available. In this case, when a backend is specified, an instance with the backend available will be used.


## Available plans

The following plans are available to non-Premium users:

* **Open** - Free plan with 10 minutes of access to quantum computers per 28-day period.
* **Pay-As-You-Go** - Pay only for your actual [usage](/docs/guides/estimate-job-run-time).

<Admonition>
The Lite Plan is deprecated and will be removed on 14 March 2025.
</Admonition>

## Current IBM Quantum Platform users

Instead of accessing IBM Quantum Platform Classic, you will now access the [upgraded version of IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/), which is integrated with IBM Cloud.  To use the new platform, users will need to follow these onboarding instructions.

### Save results from IBM Quantum Platform Classic

<Admonition type="important">
Jobs that were run on IBM Quantum Platform Classic will not be available after that version of the platform is sunset on 1 July, 2025.
</Admonition>

* Open users should save any workloads data from the classic platform prior to that date by following the steps in the [Save and retrieve jobs](/docs/guides/save-jobs) guide.
* Premium Plan, On-Prem Plan, and Startup Program users should wait to receive  guidance from their administrators regarding whether to download historical data.

### Onboard

Follow these steps to set up the new version of IBM Quantum Platform.

1. If you don't already have one, [register for an IBM Cloud account.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/registration) If you already have an IBM Quantum Platform Classic account, use the same email for this account.
2. Create an instance.
   1. Log on to the new [IBM Quantum Platform.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) Choose **IBMid** and enter your IBM Cloud account information. The dashboard opens.
   1. If you do not already have an instance, Click **Create instance** on the dashboard page.
      <Admonition type="note">
      If you have already created an instance, go to your [Instances page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) to create new ones.
      </Admonition>
   1. Specify a name and choose the type of plan you want. Scroll down to see the **Terms** link.  After reading the terms, select the **agree** checkbox and click **Next**.
   1. On the Plan inheritance page, leave the default setting (toggle is not enabled) and click **Next** if you're setting up an Open instance.  If you are not setting up an Open instance and you want a fixed set of QPUs to be available to this plan, enable the "Customize allocated compute resources" toggle, choose the QPUs you want this instance to be able to access, then click **Next**.
      <Admonition type="note">
      If you customize the allocated compute resources, the available QPUs will never be automatically updated, regardless of any changes made to the parent plan.  However, you can manually add or remove QPUs later. If you do not customize them, you will always have access to any QPU the account has access on the plan. So if in the future there is a new QPU added to the plan, the instance automatically has access to it.
      </Admonition>
   1. Choose whether you want an access group to be created for this instance and click **Create instance**.  For an Open instance, you probably don't need an access group, although creating one won't impact your usage unless you add another user to the group. You can add or remove access groups at any time from IBM Cloud. To learn more, see the [Setting up access groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-groups)  topic.

<span id="credentials"></span>

3. Create an API key from the [IBM Quantum Platform dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) and set up your credentials.
   <Admonition type="note">
   This API key is only visible for a short amount of time so be sure to store it in a safe place.  It can be used to authenticate to either region. To manage your API key, use IBM Cloud.  See [Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey) for instructions.
   </Admonition>

<span id="access"></span>
### Access
Once the onboarding steps are complete, you can now use your API key (`token` parameter) and, optionally, instance CRN (`instance` parameter) to instantiate a `QiskitRuntimeService` in your Python virtual environment.  See the [installation instructions](/docs/guides/install-qiskit#local) if you do not already have a virtual environment set up.
To copy the instance CRN, go to your [dashboard,](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) go to [Instances,](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) and click the copy icon at the end of the instance's row. The instance name listed in the first column can also be used. If an instance is not specified, all instances in your account will be available.

Setup details:
   <Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
   * The new channel name is `ibm_quantum_platform`. If you previously set your default channel to `ibm_quantum` in your saved credentials, you need to update that setting. If you were previously working with Qiskit Runtime on IBM Cloud, you can skip this.

   * It is not required to pass in an instance when saving an account or initializing the `QiskitRuntimeService()`. If an instance is not passed in, all instances will be checked when a backend is retrieved (`service.backend("backend_name")`). If an instance is passed into `save_account()`, or passed in during initialization, it is used as the default instance when retrieving backends. An instance passed in at initialization takes precedence over the one saved in the account. To copy the instance CRN, go to [Instances](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) and click the copy icon at the end of the instance's row.
   </Admonition>

   * New parameters, `region`, and `plans_preference`, have been added to the `QiskitRuntimeService()` initializer and the `save_account()` method. These can be used to prioritize certain instances on the new platform (`ibm_quantum_platform`, and temporarily, `ibm_cloud` channels) without explicitly providing the CRN.
   `region` allows you to set a region preference (`us-east` or `eu-de`), For example, if `us-east` is specified,
   then only instances from `us-east` will be checked. `plans_preference` takes a list of plans where instances will be prioritized in the order of plans given. For example, `['Open', 'Premium']` would prioritize all Open Plan instances, then all Premium Plan instances, and then the rest. You can also exclude instances of a certain plan by not specifying the plan name. Passing in `['Open']` would exclude all Premium Plan instances.
   * In addition to the IBM Cloud Resource Name (CRN), the instance name can also be passed in as the instance value.
   * If you have access to multiple accounts, only one account per API token can be used. The IBM Cloud API Token is treated as the account identifier and will unlock the resources associated with the account the token was created in. A list of your tokens per account can be found on the [API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys) page.

#### Trusted machines
<span id="save-account"></span>**If you are working in a trusted Python environment (such as on a personal laptop or workstation),** use the `save_account()` method to save your credentials locally. ([Skip to the next step](#untrusted-machine) if you are not using a trusted environment, such as a shared or public computer, to authenticate to IBM Quantum Platform.) To use `save_account()`, run `python` in your shell, then enter the following:

```python
token = "<your-API-token>"
```

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(
   token=token,
   channel="ibm_quantum_platform", # `channel` distinguishes between different account types.
   instance="instance-CRN or instance-name", # Optionally copy the instance CRN or name from the Instance section on the dashboard.
   name="account-name", # Optionally name this set of credentials.
   overwrite=True, # Only needed if you already have Cloud credentials.
   set_as_default=True # Only needed if you want these credentials to be used as the default account.
   # This is recommended if you have an IQP classic account set as the default.
)
```

Run `exit()` to close the Python shell. From now on, whenever you need to authenticate to the service, you can load your credentials with `QiskitRuntimeService()`.

```python
# Load default saved credentials
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
```
```python
# Load saved credentials if you specified a name
service = QiskitRuntimeService(name="account-name")
```

* If you previously saved an IBM Quantum Platform Classic account as the default, specify `set_as_default=True` for your new account when you use the `save_account()` method.
* If no accounts are saved as the default, an account saved on the new IBM Quantum Platform with `ibm_quantum_platform` as the channel name will be used as the default when initializing your account. `set_as_default=True` can still be used to set an account with a certain configuration of credentials as the default.
* If you are saving multiple accounts per channel, consider using the `name` parameter to differentiate them.
* Credentials are saved to `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json`.  Do not manually edit this file.

<span id="untrusted-machine"></span>
#### Untrusted machines
**Avoid executing code on an untrusted machine or an external cloud Python environment to minimize security risks.** If you must use an untrusted environment (for example, a public computer), change your API key after each use by following the instructions in the [Delete an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#delete_user_key) section to reduce risk. To initialize the service in this situation, you can use code like the following:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

# After using the following code, go to the IBM Cloud API keys page (https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys)
# and disable your API key (click Enabled slider in the API key field)
service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel="ibm_quantum_platform", token="<MY_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN>", instance="<MY_INSTANCE_CRN or name>")
```

<Admonition type="caution">
When sharing code with others, ensure that your API key is not embedded directly within the Python script. Instead, share the script without the token and provide instructions for securely setting it up.

If you accidentally share your key with someone or include it in version control like Git, immediately revoke your key by following these instructions to [delete an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#delete_user_key) to reduce risk.

## Current Qiskit Runtime on IBM Cloud users

These updates are designed to enhance your workflow while keeping your IBM Cloud integration intact.

#### New interface

Until now, you’ve been using the IBM Cloud interface to create and manage your IBM Quantum instances. With the launch of the new IBM Quantum Platform, you can still view existing instances in [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources), but managing them in [IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) gives you deeper insights and control.

The new IBM Quantum Platform offers a quantum-first experience:

* More workload insights – Better visibility into jobs and sessions.
* Improved analytics – Understand and optimize performance like never before.
* Greater control – Track, manage, and fine-tune workloads efficiently.

This transition enhances security, scalability, and user experience while keeping the IBM Cloud integration intact.

### Steps to migrate

* If you currently use the Pay-As-You-Go Plan, you don't have to do anything.  You'll just use the new [IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) interface.
* If you currently use the Lite Plan (deprecated), you can switch to [using simulators locally](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/migration-guides/local-simulators). Optionally, you can [create instances in the Open Plan,](#onboard) which lets you run jobs on quantum hardware.
