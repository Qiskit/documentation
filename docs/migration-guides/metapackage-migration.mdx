# Understand the breaking Qiskit v1.0 package changes

Qiskit v1.0 uses a different packaging structure than previous Qiskit versions and will likely cause problems in environments that use packages that are not ready for Qiskit v1.0.

<Admonition type="caution">
Do not try to upgrade an existing Python virtual environment to Qiskit v1.0 in-place. 

We will not make similar breaking packaging changes in the future. This is a one-time event, at the release of Qiskit v1.0, specifically so that our packaging story will be as easy as possible in the future.
</Admonition>

This page contains detailed information about the pre-1.0 Qiskit package and why we made the breaking packaging changes.

We know that the change is inconvenient, but this restores Qiskit to the simple package structure that most Python packages use, which will be easier for users, developers, and library authors after the Qiskit v1.0 transition is complete.


## Preface: glossary of Python packaging terminology
To better explain how the old Qiskit metapackage was structured and how that has changed with the release of Qiskit v1.0, below is a glossary of commonly used Python-packaging jargon. The following words have specific meanings that we'll use in this document.
<details>
<summary> **Click here to read through this page's glossary** </summary>

* **module**: A single Python file.

* **package**: A directory containing an `__init__.py` and other files or packages that Python can read.
  This is the actual code as installed on your computer, and is what executes when you run `import something`.
  Python considers any directory that is on the search path to be something you can import (and will import many additional items).

  This is not the same object that you `pip install` (which is a *distribution*), but typically what you `pip install` and what you `import` have the same name.

* **submodule**, **subpackage**: These are imprecise terms, but are commonly used.
  The _sub_ part means "contained inside a package".
  A submodule is a module and a subpackage is a package, but they are part of a larger package.

* **namespace package**: A package that can have submodules or subpackages installed into it by other _distributions_.
  Critically, no one distribution contributing to a namespace package necessarily owns all the installed files, so it can be tricky to completely uninstall
  or upgrade one.

* **distribution**: The compressed Python files, data files, and metadata that are downloaded when you run `pip install something`.
  Often, a distribution contains exactly one package and the metadata about how to install it (its requirements and so on), but this is not required.
  A distribution can contain zero or more modules or packages.

  If you are familiar with "package managers" outside the context of Python, such as `apt` from Debian/Ubuntu or Homebrew on macOS, then what they call a "package", Python calls a distribution, and there is no exact match for what Python calls a package.

  Most sources talking about Python packaging use the term _package_ to mean both distributions and packages, and you must refer to the context to understand what is meant.
  In general, if you `import` it, the source means "package", and if you `pip install` it, the source means "distribution".

* **search path**: When trying to `import something`, Python searches a predefined list of places for a module or package called `something`.
  The list of places is the _search path_.
  You can see and modify the search path in `sys.path`.

* **requirement**: A distribution contains information on other distributions it depends on when installed.
  Any other distribution that is necessary is a _requirement_, and the package manager (usually `pip` or `conda`) should ensure that all requirements are installed with compatible versions.
</details>

Python is highly dynamic, and many complexities can arise; for example, it's possible that a **module** or **package** does not correspond to files on disk, or that they are compiled extensions.

The **search path** is not only a search over directories, but for this discussion, only files on disk are relevant.
Further complications aren't necessary to understand the problems described in this section, so you can use the model described above.


## The old Qiskit structure

Historically, Qiskit was comprised of many Python distributions: `qiskit-terra`, the compiler core; `qiskit-aer`, the high-performance simulator; the original IBM Quantum&reg; provider; and several now-obsolete packages providing particular exploratory algorithmic or experiment-running features.
For user ease, we also provided a Python distribution called `qiskit`, which contained no code of its own, but caused all the other components to be installed.
We called this the _metapackage_, by analogy to similar concepts in other package managers.
The code of the core of Qiskit lived in `qiskit-terra`, which owned the root of the Python package `qiskit`. In other words, `qiskit-terra` controlled what happened when you ran `import qiskit`.
Until Qiskit v1.0, the `qiskit` package was a namespace package and contained a second namespace package at `qiskit.providers`.

This organization caused us and our users quite a few problems.

For example, downstream libraries that depended on Qiskit often only actually needed the compiler core, and did not require the rest of the large ecosystem that came with `pip install qiskit`.
They would therefore correctly specify their requirement as `qiskit-terra`.
However, when people tried to uninstall Qiskit by running `pip uninstall qiskit`, `pip` encountered problems:

* `pip` does not remove distributions that are now unused. So `pip uninstall qiskit` did almost nothing; there was no code in the distribution, so no code was removed.
* Even if it were to remove code, many downstream distributions would remain installed because they depended on `qiskit-terra`.
* Even if `qiskit-terra` was uninstalled, it might still leave an importable `qiskit` directory with no usable code, because it was a namespace package.

When installing or upgrading distributions with a `pip install` command, `pip` also does not take into account previous requirement resolutions.
Because there were two packages, upgrading a package that required `qiskit-terra` to be upgraded caused an invalid environment; `pip` upgraded `qiskit-terra` but left `qiskit` untouched.
It issued a warning on this and all subsequent `pip install` commands, but because nothing appeared broken, users typically ignored the warning, and `pip` did not raise an error status or forbid operations.

Over time, we removed elements from the `qiskit` metapackage until, starting with Qiskit v0.44, only `qiskit-terra` remains.
Of these components, `qiskit-aer` still exists and is actively updated, but it is now installed as a separate distribution.

Similarly, we ever more strongly discouraged other libraries from using the namespace hooks.
We removed the last Qiskit use of the hooks in non-obsolete packages with the release of Qiskit Aer v0.11 and its new `qiskit_aer` Python package, although until Qiskit v1.0 we also forced the namespace path `qiskit.providers.aer` to work.
Starting with Qiskit v1.0, we have removed the ability for packages to extend any `qiskit` namespace. Thus, `pip uninstall` on the correct distribution in a valid environment now works as expected.


## The new Qiskit structure

Starting with version 1.0, Qiskit comprises a single distribution, called `qiskit`, which installs one single package, also called `qiskit`, which owns all the code contained in its directory.
This is the normal structure of Python code, and is the simplest and least error-prone structure.

The `qiskit-terra` distribution on PyPI will never be updated to version 1.0 or beyond; it is entirely superseded by `qiskit`.
The name `qiskit-terra` is no longer involved in the installation.
However, the `qiskit-terra` package is not being removed from PyPI, and we will leave its most recent version in a working state, so old scientific code and legacy packages can more easily continue to use it.

Unfortunately, because of the metapackage legacy and deficiencies in `pip` as a package manager, it is not possible for us to make a completely smooth upgrade path for users to Qiskit v1.0, especially while some packages depend on earlier versions of Qiskit, and some require only Qiskit v1.0+.
These problems will lessen as more of the ecosystem migrates to Qiskit v1.0.

## Where did the application modules go?

You may notice that the command `pip install qiskit` will no longer includes packages such as `qiskit-aer` or `qiskit-nature`. With the removal of the metapackage structure, many of these packages were split into distributions that need to be installed separately.

Before the release of the Qiskit SDK v1.0, Qiskit was comprised of many different Python distributions, such as `qiskit-terra`, the compiler core; `qiskit-aer`, the high-performance simulator; the original IBM Quantumâ„¢ provider; and several now-obsolete packages providing particular exploratory algorithmic or experiment-running features.

If you want to install the packages that were previously included in the Qiskit metapackage, visit the [Qiskit ecosystem](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/ecosystem) to find a range of packages to suit your needs. You can also read the [v1.0 migration guide](./qiskit-1.0-installation) for more information about how to install the new distribution.
