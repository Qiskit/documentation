# Overview

This guide describes key patterns of behavior and use cases with code
examples to help you migrate code from the legacy `backend.run()` interface to use the Qiskit Runtime primitives interface (`qiskit-ibm-runtime` package).

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
- Because `backend.run()` only returned counts, the direct replacement is Qiskit Runtime `SamplerV2`.  However, if you used manual processing with `backend.run()` to return expectation values, you can now use Qiskit Runtime `EstimatorV2` instead.
- Because both `backend.run()` and the "version 1" primitives are being deprecated, this guide uses only the V2 primitives.

The `qiskit-ibm-runtime` package provides cloud access to the IBM QPUs (quantum processing units) through the primitives interface. The `backend.run()` interface coexisted with the original (V1) primitives model as the dedicated “direct hardware access” entry point.  With the introduction of the V2 primitives interface, the new `SamplerV2` class now fulfills that role. Consequentially, `backend.run()` is being deprecated, along with `qiskit-ibm-provider`, which only exposed the `backend.run()` interface.

The Qiskit Runtime primitives implement the reference Sampler V2 and Estimator V2 interfaces found in `qiskit.primitives`, and enable capabilities not available with the legacy `backend.run()` interface. These capabilities include application of advanced processing techniques for error suppression and mitigation in Estimator, the ability to efficiently sweep between arrays of parameter value sets or observables in both Sampler and Estimator, and access to the new local testing mode. Additionally, Qiskit Runtime lets users run iterative algorithm circuits back to back (session mode) or in collections of circuits without having to re-queue each job (batch mode). This results in more efficient quantum processor use and reduces the time spent running complex computations.

## Why migrate to Qiskit Runtime primitives?

Similar to the early days of classical computers, when developers had to manipulate CPU registers directly,
the early interface to QPUs simply returned the raw data coming out of the control electronics.
This was not a huge issue when QPUs lived in labs and only allowed direct access by researchers.
When IBM first brought its QPUs to the cloud, we recognized most developers would not and
should not be familiar with distilling such raw data into 0s and 1s. Therefore,
we introduced `backend.run`, our first abstraction for accessing QPUs. This allowed developers
to operate on a data format they were more familiar with and focus on the bigger picture.

As access to QPUs became more widespread, and with more quantum algorithms being developed,
we again recognized the need for a higher-level abstraction. This led to the introduction of
the Qiskit [primitives interface](/guides/primitives), which are optimized for two core tasks in quantum algorithm development:
expectation value estimation (Estimator) and circuit sampling (Sampler). The goal is once
again to help developers to focus more on innovation and less on data conversion.

For backward compatibility, the `backend.run` interface continues to exist in Qiskit. However, it is deprecated
in Qiskit Runtime, as most of the IBM Quantum users have migrated to V2 primitives due to their improved
usability and efficiency.

## Basic steps to migrate to primitives

### Step 1: Determine which primitive to use

When migrating, the key to writing an equivalent algorithm using
primitives is to first identify what minimal unit of information
your algorithm is based on:

-   If it uses an **expectation value** of a certain observable with respect to a quantum state (a real number), you will now use Estimator.

    An expectation value of an observable could be the target quantity in scenarios where knowing a quantum state is not relevant. This often occurs in optimization problems or chemistry applications. For example, when trying to discover the extremal energy of a system.
-   If it uses a **probability distribution** from sampling the device, you will now use Sampler.


    A probability distribution is often of interest in optimization problems that return a classical bit string, encoding a certain solution to a problem at hand. In these cases, you might be interested in finding a bit string that corresponds to a ket value with the largest probability of being measured from a quantum state, for example.

### Step 2: Change imports as necessary

Follow the steps in the appropriate topic to change your import options and other setup information:

- [Migrate from `qiskit-ibm-provider`](qiskit-runtime-from-ibm-provider)
- [Migrate from `qiskit-ibmq-provider`](qiskit-runtime-from-ibmq-provider)

### Step 3: Replace the call to `backend.run` with a call to `qiskit_ibm_runtime`.

See these topics for instructions:

-  [Update code that performs circuit sampling](qiskit-runtime-examples#sampler-algorithm)
-  [Update code that calculates expectation values](qiskit-runtime-examples#estimator-algorithm)
-  [Common use cases (basic, parameterized, and dynamic circuits)](qiskit-runtime-use-case)


### Step 3a: replace any `backend.run` options with `qiskit_ibm_runtime` options.

See the following topics for instructions:

- [Migrate options](qiskit-runtime-options)
- Common use cases [Options section](qiskit-runtime-use-case#migrate-options)
