# Migrate to primitives for users of third-party providers with `backend.run`

The `backend.run` interface was the primary access point to quantum hardware and simulators offered by third-party providers that integrate with Qiskit. The evolution of [user access patterns for QPUs](/docs/migration-guides/qiskit-runtime#why-migrate-to-qiskit-runtime-primitives) led to the Qiskit primitives (`Sampler` and `Estimator`) superseding this interface. However, not all third-party providers have transitioned to the primitives framework, and `backend.run` remains in Qiskit for backward compatibility.

This guide is for you if you have written or want to write code using `Sampler` and `Estimator`
primitives but need to interact with a provider that still relies on `backend.run`. If you are a
provider developer looking to implement and expose your own `Sampler` and
`Estimator` primitives, see the [Migrate provider interfaces from backend.run to primitives](/docs/migration-guides/external-providers-primitives-v2) guide instead.

For providers that don't expose native primitives, the Qiskit SDK offers wrappers for `backend.run` that you can
use out-of the box: the [`BackendSamplerV2`.](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendSamplerV2) and
[`BackendEstimatorV2`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendEstimatorV2) classes.

If you are already familiar with the [`SamplerV2`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/sampler-v2)
and [`EstimatorV2`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/estimator-v2) interfaces, the transition to
[`BackendSamplerV2`.](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendSamplerV2) and
[`BackendEstimatorV2`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendEstimatorV2) is seamless, as
these classes follow the same usage patterns. The inputs to the primitives should follow
the primitive unified bloc (PUB) syntax, and the output formats should follow the
`PrimitiveResult` interface. See the [Primitive inputs and outputs](/docs/guides/primitive-input-output) for details.

The two main differences with the implementations of [`SamplerV2`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/sampler-v2)
and [`EstimatorV2`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/estimator-v2) are:

1.  The `backend` input passed during the "backend primitive" instantiation. This input argument allows internal provider access
through `backend` and should not be confused
with the `mode` input argument of [`SamplerV2`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/sampler-v2)
and [`EstimatorV2`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/estimator-v2).

2. Which `options` can be set. Options should be provided as a `dict` instead of an `Options` instance.
  * `BackendSamplerV2` includes `default_shots`, `seed_simulator` and `run_options`.
  * `BackendEstimatorV2` includes `default_precision`, `abelian_grouping`, `seed_simulator`, and `run_options`.
  * The `run_options` field defines the options to pass through to the `.` method of the wrapped backend instance.

Because these wrappers are independent of `qiskit_ibm_runtime`, they do not offer access to execution
modes (`Session` and `Batch`), local testing modes, or any other `qiskit_ibm_runtime`-specific feature. These are up to the
third-party provider to implement and expose, ideally through a native primitive.
If the third-party backend requires a more fine-grained option handling
strategy that is not covered by the out-of-the-box wrapper, you can extend the
[`BackendSamplerV2`.](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendSamplerV2) and
[`BackendEstimatorV2`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendEstimatorV2) interfaces through subclassing to fit the specific
interface needs.

The following is an example usage of the [`BackendSamplerV2`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendSamplerV2)
class with a fictional third-party provider backend that only implements `backend`:

``` python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, generate_preset_pass_manager
from qiskit.primitives import BackendSamplerV2
from qiskit_fictional_provider import BackendRunProvider

# get backend and pass onto BackendSamplerV2
backend = BackendRunProvider("").get_backend("fictional_backend")
sampler = BackendSamplerV2(backend, options={"default_shots": 1000})

# from this point on, use sampler as any SamplerV2
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

# assuming that third-party backend is compatible with our transpilation pipeline
# (whether this step is required or not depends on the provider)
pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend)
tqc = pm.run(qc)

# run using pub syntax
result = sampler.run([qc]).result()
```
