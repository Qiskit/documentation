# Migrate from Qiskit Pulse to fractional gates

With the introduction of [fractional gates](../guides/fractional-gates), pulse-level control on all IBM Quantum&reg; processors has been deprecated and will be removed in early 2025. Additionally, the `qiskit.pulse` module has been deprecated as of the Qiskit SDK v1.3.0 and will be removed in Qiskit SDK v2.0.0. This change was motivated by our ongoing focus on utility-scale experiments and support for users exploring applications that might lead to quantum advantage.

## Execute single- and two-qubit rotations directly with fractional gates

The most common use-case of pulse-level control was to build custom pulse schedules that modify the `ECR` or `RX` pulses to directly execute single- and two-qubit rotations. The typical process was to use the `RXCalibrationBuilder` and `RZXCalibrationBuilder` (or `RZXCalibrationBuilderNoEcho`) and add either a `RXGate` or `RZXGate` instruction to a QPU's `target`, then build a transpilation pipeline containing the calibration builder passes to calibrate the single- and two-qubit rotations for a specified angle. In the background this created a *calibration*, which is a map between a `ScheduleBlock` and a gate in a `QuantumCircuit`.

You can now accomplish this on Heron processors using the new `use_fractional_gates` flag. As specified in the [fractional gates guide](/docs/guides/fractional-gates), both $R_X(\theta)$ and $R_ZZ(\theta)$ must be loaded using this flag, which returns a backend whose `Target` attribute contains information about these gates.

```python
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend('ibm_torino', use_fractional_gates=True)
```


## Use Qiskit Dynamics

The `qiskit.pulse` module contained much more functionality than just executing single and two-qubit rotations more efficiently. Much of the control over device physics can be modeled using the [Qiskit Dynamics](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-dynamics/) package found in the Qiskit Ecosystem. In particular, the package has its own analogous representation of many of the features provided by `qiskit.pulse` in the form of a `qiskit_dynamics.signals` module.  The documentation of this package contains a few tutorials which may be helpful:
