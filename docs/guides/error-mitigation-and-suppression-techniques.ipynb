    "## Dynamical decoupling\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum circuits are executed on IBM&reg; hardware as sequences of microwave pulses that need to be scheduled and run at precise time intervals.\n",
    "Unfortunately, unwanted interactions between qubits can lead to coherent errors on idling qubits. Dynamical decoupling works by inserting pulse sequences on idling qubits to approximately cancel out the effect of these errors. Each inserted pulse sequence amounts to an identity operation, but the physical presence of the pulses has the effect of suppressing errors.\n",
    "There are many possible choices of pulse sequences, and which sequence is better for each particular case remains an [active area of research](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.20.064027).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that dynamical decoupling is mainly useful for circuits containing gaps in which some qubits sit idle without any operations acting on them. If the operations in the circuit are packed very densely, such that all of the qubits are busy most of the time, then the addition of dynamical decoupling pulses might not improve performance. In fact, it could even worsen performance due to imperfections in the pulses themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below depicts dynamical decoupling with an XX pulse sequence. The abstract circuit on the left is mapped onto a microwave pulse schedule on the top right. The bottom right depicts the same schedule, but with a sequence of two X pulses inserted during an idle period of the first qubit.\n",

    "\n",
    "Twirling, also known as [randomized compiling](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.052325), is a widely used technique for converting arbitrary noise channels into noise channels with more specific structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pauli twirling is a special kind of twirling that uses Pauli operations. It has the effect of transforming any quantum channel into a Pauli channel. Performed alone, it can mitigate coherent noise because coherent noise tends to accumulate quadratically with the number of operations, whereas Pauli noise accumulates linearly. Pauli twirling is often combined with other error mitigation techniques that work better with Pauli noise than with arbitrary noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pauli twirling is implemented by sandwiching a chosen set of gates with randomly chosen single-qubit Pauli gates in such a way that the ideal effect of the gate remains the same. The result is that a single circuit is replaced with a random ensemble of circuits, all with the same ideal effect. When sampling the circuit, samples are drawn from multiple random instances, rather than just a single one.\n",

    " It is based on the notion of twirled measurements, which are accomplished by randomly substituting measurement gates by a sequence of (1) a Pauli X gate, (2) a measurement, and (3) classical bit flip. Just like in standard gate twirling, this sequence is equivalent to a plain measurement in the absence of noise, as depicted in the following diagram:\n",

    "Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a technique for mitigating errors in estimating expectation values of observables. While it often improves results, it is not guaranteed to produce an unbiased result.\n",

    "1. _Noise amplification_: The original quantum circuit is executed multiple times at different noise rates.\n",
    "2. _Extrapolation_: The ideal result is estimated by extrapolating the noisy expectation value results to the zero-noise limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the noise amplification and extrapolation stages can be implemented in many different ways. Qiskit Runtime implements noise amplification by \"digital gate folding,\" which means that two-qubit gates are replaced with equivalent sequences of the gate and its inverse. For example, replacing a unitary $U$ with $U U^\\dagger U$ would yield a noise amplification factor of 3. For the extrapolation, you can choose from one of several functional forms, including a linear fit or an exponential fit.\n",
