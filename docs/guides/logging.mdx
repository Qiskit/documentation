# Logging for Qiskit Runtime

IBM Cloud&reg; services, such as Qiskit Runtime, generate platform logs that you can use to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions in your account, and troubleshoot problems.

You can use [IBM Cloud Logs Routing,](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-about) which is a platform service, to route platform logs in your account to a destination of your choice by configuring a tenant that defines where platform logs are sent. For more information, see [About Logs Routing.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/logs-router?topic=logs-router-about)

You can use [IBM Cloud Logs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-logs) to visualize and alert on platform logs that are generated in your account and routed by IBM Cloud Logs Routing to an IBM Cloud Logs instance.
