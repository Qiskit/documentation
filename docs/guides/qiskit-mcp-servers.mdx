# Qiskit MCP Servers

Qiskit MCP Servers is a collection of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers that integrate quantum computing capabilities into AI systems. These servers enable AI assistants, large language models (LLMs), and agents to access IBM Quantum&reg; services and Qiskit libraries.

## When should I use Qiskit MCP Servers?

Qiskit MCP Servers allow AI assistants to help you with quantum computing tasks. This includes some of the following examples:

- Generating quantum code with contextual awareness 
- Answering quantum computing questions directly from reliable sources
- Connecting to real quantum hardware automatically
- Analyzing and selecting optimal quantum backends
- Executing quantum circuits and tracking job status

## What is included?

The following MCP servers are available:

### Qiskit Code Assistant MCP Server

Provides intelligent quantum code completion and assistance through the [Qiskit Code Assistant](/docs/guides/qiskit-code-assistant). This server integrates the Qiskit Code Assistant capabilities directly into MCP-compatible AI tools.

As with any other feature from Qiskit Code Assistant, this MCP server only works for IBM Quantum Premium Plan users registered on the [IBM Quantum Platform.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/)

### Qiskit IBM Runtime MCP Server

Provides access to IBM Quantum cloud services through the Qiskit IBM Runtime. This enables AI assistants to interact with quantum backends, submit jobs, and retrieve results.

## Install Qiskit MCP Servers

To use Qiskit MCP Servers, you need:

- Python 3.10 or higher (3.11+ recommended)
- An IBM Quantum account with API token (see [Set up your IBM Cloud account](/docs/guides/cloud-setup))

Install all the available Qiskit MCP servers by running the following command from a terminal:

```bash
pip install qiskit-mcp-servers
```

You can also install the individual MCP servers:

```bash
pip install qiskit-code-assistant-mcp-server
pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime-mcp-server
```

## Configure Qiskit MCP Servers

### Set environment variables

Set up the required environment variables for authentication.

For the Qiskit IBM Runtime or Qiskit Code Assistant MCP Servers:

```bash
export QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN="your_token"
```

You can find your API token in your [IBM Quantum account settings](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/).

### Configure your MCP client

Configure your MCP-compatible client (such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other AI tools) to use the Qiskit MCP servers. The exact configuration depends on your client. For example, in a typical MCP client configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qiskit-ibm-runtime": {
      "command": "qiskit-ibm-runtime-mcp-server"
    },
    "qiskit-code-assistant": {
      "command": "qiskit-code-assistant-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

Refer to your MCP client's documentation for specific configuration instructions.

## Test the MCP servers

You can test the MCP servers interactively using the MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector qiskit-ibm-runtime-mcp-server
```

Or for the Qiskit Code Assistant MCP server:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector qiskit-code-assistant-mcp-server
```
