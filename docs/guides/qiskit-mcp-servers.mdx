# Qiskit MCP Servers

Qiskit MCP Servers is a collection of [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers that integrate quantum computing capabilities into AI systems. These servers enable AI assistants, large language models (LLMs), and agents to access IBM Quantum&reg; services and Qiskit libraries.

    This is an open-source project. For the most up-to-date information, detailed API coverage, and advanced configurations, refer to the [Qiskit MCP Servers GitHub repository.](https://github.com/Qiskit/mcp-servers)

## When should I use Qiskit MCP Servers?

Qiskit MCP Servers allow AI assistants to help you with quantum computing tasks, such as the following:

- Generating quantum code with contextual awareness 
- Answering quantum computing questions directly from reliable sources
- Connecting to real quantum hardware automatically
- Analyzing and selecting optimal quantum backends
- Executing quantum circuits and tracking job status

## What is included?

The following MCP servers are available:

### Qiskit Code Assistant MCP Server

Provides intelligent quantum code completion and assistance through the [Qiskit Code Assistant](/docs/guides/qiskit-code-assistant). This server integrates the Qiskit Code Assistant capabilities directly into MCP-compatible AI tools.

As with any other feature from Qiskit Code Assistant, this MCP server only works for IBM Quantum Premium Plan users registered on [IBM Quantum Platform.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/)

### Qiskit Runtime MCP Server

Provides access to IBM Quantum cloud services through Qiskit Runtime. This enables AI assistants to interact with quantum backends, submit jobs, and retrieve results.

## Install Qiskit MCP Servers

To use Qiskit MCP Servers, you need:

- Python 3.10 or later (3.11+ recommended)
- An IBM Quantum account and API token (see [Set up your IBM Cloud account](/docs/guides/cloud-setup) for instructions.)

Install all the available Qiskit MCP servers by running the following command from a terminal:

```bash
pip install qiskit-mcp-servers
```

You can also install the individual MCP servers:

```bash
pip install qiskit-code-assistant-mcp-server
pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime-mcp-server
```

## Configure Qiskit MCP Servers

### Set environment variables

Set up the required environment variables for authentication.

For the Qiskit Runtime or Qiskit Code Assistant MCP Servers:

```bash
export QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN="<your_token>"
```

You can find your API token in your [IBM Quantum account settings.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/)

### Configure the MCP client

You can configure an MCP-compatible client (such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other AI tools) to use the Qiskit MCP servers. The exact configuration depends on your client. For example, an MCP client configuration file might look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "qiskit-ibm-runtime": {
      "command": "qiskit-ibm-runtime-mcp-server"
    },
    "qiskit-code-assistant": {
      "command": "qiskit-code-assistant-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

Refer to your MCP client's documentation for specific configuration instructions.

## Test the MCP servers

You can test the MCP servers interactively by using the MCP Inspector:

```bash
# Test the Qiskit Runtime MCP Server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector qiskit-ibm-runtime-mcp-server
```

```bash
# Test the Qiskit Code Assistant MCP Server
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector qiskit-code-assistant-mcp-server
```
