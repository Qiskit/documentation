# Manage ID provider users

You can integrate with your external identity provider (IDP) to securely authenticate external users to your IBM Cloud account. By using an external provider, you can provide a way for users in your company to use single sign-on (SSO). You can connect your cloud account to an external IDP one of the following ways:

- Use the [IBM Cloud SAML service provider (SP)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-ibm-idp-integration#federate-cloud-saml)
- Use [App ID](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-ibm-idp-integration#federate-appid) (might incur a cost)
- [Federate your users to all IBM products with IBMid](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-ibm-idp-integration#federate-ibmid)

<Admonition type="tip">
After connecting your IDP, you can set up dynamic rules so you don't have to manually add every user to every group when they join.  See [Enabling authentication from an external identity provider](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-ibm-idp-integration#app-id-dynamic-rules) for instructions.
