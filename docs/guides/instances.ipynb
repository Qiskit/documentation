    "Access to IBM Quantum Platform services is controlled by the **instances** to which you are assigned. Users can belong to more than one instance at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance is a deployment of Qiskit Runtime. You need a different instance for every service plan (such as Open or Standard) you use in every region that you want to use. The account manager and anyone with enough permission can create an instance and define its configuration, such as its allocations, usage limits, quantum computers, and user permissions. Each instance is identified by a unique Cloud Resource Name (CRN).  This CRN can be used when sending workloads from your Qiskit programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IBM Quantum Platform [dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) displays the instances to which you have access.  Depending on your access, you can view full details, edit, and delete instances on the [Instances page.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you understand which instance you are using, because all instances that are not associated with the Open Plan incur a cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, users who sign up for an IBM Quantum account are assigned to the Open Plan.\n",
    "Open Plan users can run quantum circuits on the world's best QPUs for free (up to 10 minutes quantum time per 28-day rolling window). The QPU usage can be tracked on the [Platform dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) and the [Workloads](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/workloads) pages.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The jobs you run and the jobs run by other collaborators in the same instance count toward the reported usage for that instance. You can view an instance's usage on the [Instances](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) page, or, for those with the proper authority, the [Analytics](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/analytics) page.  Note that the pages might show different usage numbers because the Instance page shows usage in a 28-day rolling window prior to the current timestamp, while the Analytics page uses full-day boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If an instance has been marked as \"limited\" by your administrator (you will see a \"Remaining\" column in the usage area) and the instance exceeds its allocation (defined by your administrator) within the 28-day rolling window, any active workload will continue running (including sessions) but pending workloads will remain in the queue until more time is available. If an instance is not limited and the instance exceeds its allocation, jobs run with that instance are likely to run at a lower priority and experience longer queue times.\n",

When an instance is passed in, only backends and jobs from that instance are available (allowed in Qiskit Runtime v0.40.1 and later).\n",

    "1. If an instance was passed into [`save_account()`,](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit-runtime-service#save_account) it is used.\n",
