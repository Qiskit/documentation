    "Access to IBM Quantum Platform services is controlled by the **instances** to which you are assigned. Users can belong to more than one instance at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance is a deployment of Qiskit Runtime. You need a different instance for every service plan (such as Open or Standard) you use in every region that you want to use. The account manager and anyone with enough permission can create an instance and define its configuration, such as its allocations, usage limits, quantum computers, and user permissions. Each instance is identified by a unique Cloud Resource Name (CRN).  This CRN can be used when sending workloads from your Qiskit programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IBM Quantum Platform [dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) displays the instances to which you have access.  Depending on your access, you can view full details, edit, and delete instances on the [Instances page.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you understand which instance you are using, because all instances that are not associated with the Open Plan incur a cost.\n",

    "<span id=\"open-plan\"></span>\n",
    "## Open Plan instance\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, users who sign up for an IBM Quantum account are assigned to the Open Plan and the Open Plan's instance, `ibm-q/open/main`. To guarantee that everyone can use the quantum computers allocated to the plan fairly, **an individual can have no more than three jobs running and/or in the queue (across all quantum computers) at the same time.** Submitting more than three jobs at a time will return error [#3458](../errors#3458), and additional jobs will be canceled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those using the Open Plan instance have up to 10 minutes total of quantum time per 28-day rolling window. Open Plan users can track their usage on the [Platform dashboard,](https://quantum.ibm.com/) [Workloads,](https://quantum.ibm.com/workloads) and [Account](https://quantum.ibm.com/account) pages.\n",

    "By default, users who sign up for an IBM Quantum account are assigned to the Standard Plan, which is a paid plan. To use this plan, you must create an instance and assign it to the plan. All workloads sent to QPUs by using this plan incur a charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The jobs you run and the jobs run by other collaborators in the same instance count toward the reported usage for that instance. You can view an instance's usage on the [Instances](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) page, or, for those with the proper authority, the [Analytics](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/analytics) page.  Note that the pages might show different usage numbers because the Instance page shows usage in a 28-day rolling window prior to the current timestamp, while the Analytics page uses full-day boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If an instance has been marked as \"limited\" by your administrator (you will see a \"Remaining\" column in the usage area) and the instance exceeds its allocation (defined by your administrator) within the 28-day rolling window, any active workload will continue running (including sessions) but pending workloads will remain in the queue until more time is available. If an instance is not limited and the instance exceeds its allocation, jobs run with that instance are likely to run at a lower priority and experience longer queue times.\n",

When an instance is passed in, only backends and jobs from that instance are available (allowed in Qiskit Runtime v0.40.1 and later).\n",

    "1. If an instance was passed into [`save_account()`,](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit-runtime-service#save_account) it is used.\n",
    "2. If your account has access to multiple instances but only one can access the requested QPU, the instance with access is selected. If this instance is not associated with a free plan, a cost will be incurred.\n",
    "3. If your account has access to multiple instances that can access the requested QPU, the system uses your specified plan preferences (set on the [`QiskitRuntimeService()`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit-runtime-service#qiskitruntimeservice) initializer or the [`save_account()`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit-runtime-service#save_account) method) to choose a plan and instance.\n",
