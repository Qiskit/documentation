    "## How to use fractional gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, these fractional gates work by directly executing an $R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ and $R_X(\\theta)$ rotation for an arbitrary angle. Use of the $R_X(\\theta)$ gate can reduce the duration and error for single-qubit rotations of arbitrary angle by up to a factor of two. The direct execution of the $R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ gate rotation avoids decomposition into multiple `CZGate` objects, similarly reducing a circuit's duration and error. This is especially useful for circuits that contain many single- and two-qubit rotations, such as when simulating the dynamics of a quantum system or when using a variational ansatz with many parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While these types of gates are in the [library of standard gates](./circuit-library) which a `QuantumCircuit` can possess, they can only be used on specific IBM Quantum QPUs, and which must be loaded with the flag `use_fractional_gates` set to `True` (shown below). This flag will ensure that fractional gates are included in the backend's `Target` for the transpiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "service = QiskitRuntimeService()\n",
    "backend = service.backend('ibm_torino', use_fractional_gates=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This code example demonstrates how to use fractional gates in the context of a workflow that simulates the dynamics of an Ising chain using fractional gates. The circuit duration is then compared against a backend that does not use fractional gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Admonition title=\"Note about reported error rates\" type=\"note\">\n",
    "  The error value reported in the `Target` of a backend with fractional gates enabled is just a copy of the non-fractional gate's counterpart (which may not be the same). This is because the reporting of error rates on the fractional gates is not yet supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "  However, since the gate time of fractional versus non-fractional gates are the same, it is a reasonable assumption that their error rates are comparable -- especially when the dominant source of error in a circuit is due to relaxation.\n",

If a circuit contains any $R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ gates with an angle outside of this range, then the standard transpilation pipeline will generally correct this with an appropriate circuit transformation (through the [`FoldRzzAngle`](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/transpiler-passes-fold-rzz-angle) pass).  However, for any $R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ gate containing one or more [`Parameter`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.Parameter)s, the transpiler will assume these parameters will be assigned angles within this range at runtime. The job will fail if any of the parameter values specified in the PUB submitted to Qiskit Runtime are outside of this range."
