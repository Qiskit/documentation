# Job limits

When you send a job to an IBM&reg; QPU, it is first sent to the job validation service.  This service tries to ensure that the job will be able to run on the QPU so you don't have to wait for it to go through the queue and then have the job fail.  These checks include enforcing the following described limits. If these limits are exceeded, that workload cannot be handled by the quantum software stack and will usually fail.


<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
- Certain primitive options increase the circuit size.  The described limits are checked _after_ the expected increase in circuit size. In particular, these options increase circuit size:
  - Dynamical decoupling and gate-folding ZNE introduce additional gates that are included in the instructions for the [Maximum number of low-level instructions per qubit](#per-qubit) limit.
  - Gate-folding ZNE introduces additional two-qubit gates relevant to the [Maximum number of two-qubit gates per job](#2-qubit-limit) limit. The number of two-qubit gates is multiplied by the sum of noise factors requested in gate-folding ZNE.
- The limits reported by the `backend.configuration()` fields `max_shots` and `max_experiments` are no longer relevant or enforced. These fields will be removed in the near future.
- These limits are per job, not per Primitive Unified Bloc (PUB).

<span id="max-shots"></span>
## Maximum executions

At most, **10 million** executions are allowed for Sampler jobs (Estimator jobs can be split into smaller sub-jobs, so this limit doesn't apply).  The number of executions is the number of circuits times the number of shots, where the circuits are those generated after PUB elements are broadcasted.

For example, if you have a PUB with one circuit and parameters with shape (4, 1), this would render 4 circuits. If you requested 2,000 shots, then the total number of executions is $4 \times 2,000 = 8,000$.

Note that if you enable Pauli-twirling in your Sampler job, the total number of shots is based on the `num_randomizations` and `shots_per_randomization` values. See [TwirlingOptions](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-twirling-options) for more details.

<span id="per-qubit"></span>
## Maximum number of low-level instructions per qubit

The service permits up to **26.8 million control-system instructions per qubit**. This ensures that the user circuits fit within the control system's instruction memory.  The below example shows how to transpile a circuit and count how many of each instruction there are. 

The following table describes how the system translates instruction set architecture (ISA) circuit instructions to control system instructions when calculating this limit.

| Instruction | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| `rz`          | 1     |
| `delay`       | 1     |
| `sx`          | 2     |
| `x`           | 2     |
| `cx`          | 5     |
| `cz`          | 5     |
| `ecr`         | 5     |
| `measure`     | 10    |
| `reset`       | 17    |
| `init`        | 50    |

### Example

Define circuits, transpile them, and get a count of how many gates will be run.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.transpiler import generate_preset_pass_manager
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

num_qubits = 50
ghz = QuantumCircuit(num_qubits)
ghz.h(range(num_qubits))
ghz.cx(0, range(1, num_qubits))
op_counts = ghz.count_ops()

# Choose the least busy backend
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)

pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(optimization_level=3, backend=backend)
transpiled_ghz = pm.run(ghz)
op_counts = transpiled_ghz.count_ops()

print(f"Post-Transpilation gates: {op_counts}")
```

<span id="2-qubit-limit"></span>
## Maximum number of single- and two-qubit gates per circuit

The maximum number of single-qubit gates are as follows:
- 30 million RZ gates
- 20 million SX gates

The maximum number of two-qubit gates per circuit is five million. This ensures that the job can be manipulated within the memory limits of the low-level software stack.
