# QPU information

IBM&reg; offers both open and premium access to a wide variety of quantum processing units (QPUs). All QPUs deployed by IBM are based on superconducting qubit technology, as the control and scalability of this technology pave a clear path to achieving quantum advantage with these QPUs. You can see the full details of all IBM QPUs on the [Quantum processing units page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/computers).

## QPU versioning

Each QPU has a version number in the form X.Y.Z (major.minor.revision). A circuit compiled for a given version number is guaranteed to run on that QPU. If the revision number changes, the circuit will continue to run. If the major or minor number changes, the circuit is not guaranteed to run, although it may do so. The conditions under which a version number may change are listed below:

### Major version

The major version will increment for changes such as:

*   Sample changes.
*   Major changes to the control electronics.
*   Moving the QPU to a new location, if significant behavior changes result.

### Minor version

The minor version will increment for changes such as:

*   Warmup / cool-down cycles.
*   Swapping out some electronics, if the replacement appreciably affects operation.
*   Changing the direction of a controlled-NOT gate.
*   Dropping a gate for some duration of time due to calibration issues, and corrections cannot readily be done in software.

### Revision version

The revision version number will increment for fixes that do not break the existing compiled circuit. These changes include:

*   Manual calibrations to improve fidelities.
*   Small electronics changes that don’t affect operation.
*   QPU software updates.

## QPU configuration values

The following is a subset of QPU configuration values available in IBM Quantum Platform and from [Qiskit](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/ibm-backend).

These values are shown on both the [Compute resources page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/computers) and the details page for each QPU.

*   **Name** - The unique name assigned to a specific QPU. QPUs hosted on IBM Cloud® have names that begin with `ibmq_*` (older QPUs) or `ibm_*` (newer QPUs). All QPUs are given a city name, e.g., `ibmq_johannesburg`. This name does not indicate where the actual QPU is hosted. They are named after IBM&reg; locations around the world.
*   **Qubits** - The number of physical qubits in a QPU.
*   **2Q error (best)** - The lowest two-qubit (2Q) error on any edge of the device as measured from isolated 2Q randomized benchmarking.
*   **2Q error (layered)** - Average error per layered gate (EPLG) in a chain of 100 qubits. Average EPLG measures the average gate error in a layered chain of $N$ qubits ($N$=100 here). It is derived from a similar quantity known as the layer fidelity (LF) where EPLG$_{100}$ = 4/5(1-LF$^{\frac{1}{99}}$) and layer fidelity is the process fidelity of the layered chain of $N$ qubits. For details, see the paper [Benchmarking quantum processor performance at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05933). Note that in the paper EPLG is defined for process error, but for consistency with the individually reported gate errors here it is quoted for average gate error, thus the factor of 4/5.
*   **CLOPS** (or CLOPS_h) - Circuit layer operations per second, is a measure of how many layers of a 100x100 circuit (hardware-aware circuit) a QPU (quantum processing unit) can execute per unit of time.
*   **Status** - The QPU status.
*   **Region** - Location of the data center where your data and experiments will be hosted and processed.
*   **Total pending jobs** - The total number of jobs that you have submitted to this QPU.
*   **Processor type** - Reflects the [topology](/docs/guides/qpu-information) and indicates the approximate qubit count.

<Admonition type="note" title="Average gate fidelity">
Note that the metric for median ECR error (for Eagle processors) and median CZ error (for Heron processors) is the [average gate fidelity](/docs/api/qiskit/quantum_info#average_gate_fidelity), which is the average over all possible input states of the fidelity between the state produced by the actual operation and the state produced by the ideal operation.

## Additional information available on the details page for each QPU

To access the details page, select [Compute resources](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/computers) from the left-hand menu, then click the name of the QPU.

<span id="native-gates-on-platform"></span>
* **Basis gates** - Each [processor family](/docs/guides/processor-types) has a native gate set. By default, the QPUs in each family only support running the gates and operations in the native gate set. Thus, every gate in the circuit must be translated (by the transpiler) to the elements of this set. To find the native gates (also called basis gates) for a QPU, select its name on the [Compute resources](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/computers) page. Note that the non-unitary operations are not listed here; use the [method in Qiskit](/docs/guides/get-qpu-information#native-gates-with-qiskit) to see all native gates and operations for a QPU. See a list of all native gates in [this table](#native-gates).

    <Admonition type="note" title="Native gates and basis gates">
    The terms native gates and basis gates are often used interchangeably. The native gates are those that calibrations have been done for on the QPU, so the QPU can understand and execute them without further instruction. However, you can pass a subset of the native gates as the basis gates to the transpiler. For information about changing the basis gates, see the [Represent quantum computers](/docs/guides/represent-quantum-computers#basis-gates) topic.

*   **Version** - The version number of a QPU in the form `major.minor.revision`. See [QPU versioning](#qpu-versioning) for details on how this number is assigned.

*   **Calibration data** - Download the calibration data as a CSV file or click the arrow to display the Topology diagram, Individual qubit readout graph, or the Calibration data table. You can customize the data that is shown, depending on the view you have open. For example, on the Topology diagram, you can choose the data you want to see for connections and qubits. The colored bars associated with the diagram or graph indicate the range that is shown, with the average value marked. The color maximum and minimum change depending on the QPU.

    *   <span id="coupling-map">**Topology diagram** or **coupling map** </span> - A diagram that indicates the pairs of qubits that support two-qubit gate operations between them. This is also called the coupling map or connectivity. Qubits are represented as circles and the supported two-qubit gate operations are displayed as lines connecting the qubits.
    * **Individual qubit properties** - Shows the selected property for each qubit on the QPU. You can view properties such as:
       - **T1 (Relaxation Time)**: The T1 time represents the average duration a qubit remains in its excited state $|1\rangle$ before decaying to its ground state $|0\rangle$ due to energy relaxation. This parameter is used to characterize the qubit's energy relaxation behavior, and is expressed in units of seconds (s).
       - **T2 (Dephasing Time)**: The T2 time denotes the timescale over which a qubit maintains phase coherence of a superposition between the $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ states. It accounts for both energy relaxation and pure dephasing processes, providing insight into the qubit's coherence properties.
       - **frequency**: This parameter specifies the resonant frequency of the qubit, indicating the energy difference between the $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ states, expressed in hertz (Hz).
       - **anharmonicity**: Anharmonicity is the difference in energy between the first and second excited states of the qubit, also expressed in hertz (Hz).
       - **readout_error**: The readout error quantifies the average probability of incorrectly measuring a qubit's state. It is commonly calculated as the mean of prob_meas0_prep1 and prob_meas1_prep0, providing a single metric for measurement fidelity.
       - **prob_meas0_prep1**: This parameter indicates the probability of measuring a qubit in the $|0\rangle$ state when it was intended to be prepared in the $|1\rangle$ state, denoted as $P(0|1)$. It reflects errors in state preparation and measurement (SPAM), particularly measurement errors in superconducting qubits.
       - **prob_meas1_prep0**: Similarly, this parameter represents the probability of measuring a qubit in the $|1\rangle$ state when it was intended to be prepared in the $|0\rangle$ state, denoted as $P(1|0)$. Like prob_meas0_prep1, it reflects SPAM errors, with measurement errors being the predominant contributor in superconducting qubits.
       - **readout_length**: The readout_length specifies the duration of the readout operation for a qubit. It measures the time from the initiation of the measurement pulse to the completion of signal digitization, after which the system is ready for the next operation. Understanding this parameter is crucial for optimizing circuit execution, especially when incorporating mid-circuit measurements.
