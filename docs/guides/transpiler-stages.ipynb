The specific passes that make up each stage depends on the arguments passed to `generate_preset_pass_manager`. The `optimization_level` is a positional argument that must be specified; it is an integer that can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Higher values indicate heavier but more costly optimization (see [Transpilation defaults and configuration options](defaults-and-configuration-options)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended way to transpile a circuit is to create a preset staged pass manager and then run that pass manager on the circuit, as described in [Transpile with pass managers](transpile-with-pass-managers). However, a simpler but less customizable alternative is to use the [`transpile`](/docs/api/qiskit/compiler#qiskit.compiler.transpile) function. This function accepts the circuit directly as an argument. As with `generate_preset_pass_manager`, the specific transpiler passes used depend on the arguments, such as `optimization_level`, passed to `transpile`. In fact, internally the `transpile` function calls `generate_preset_pass_manager` to create a preset staged pass manager and runs it on the circuit."

    "## Layout stage\n",
    "The next stage involves the layout or connectivity of the backend a circuit will be sent to.  In general, quantum circuits are abstract entities whose qubits are \"virtual\" or \"logical\" representations of actual qubits used in computations.  To execute a sequence of gates, a one-to-one mapping from the \"virtual\" qubits to the \"physical\" qubits in an actual quantum device is necessary.  This mapping is stored as a `Layout` object and is part of the constraints defined within a backend's [instruction set architecture (ISA)](./transpile#instruction-set-architecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![This image illustrates qubits being mapped from the wire representation to a diagram that represents how the qubits are connected on the QPU.](/docs/images/guides/transpiler-stages/layout-mapping.avif \"Qubit mapping\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of mapping is extremely important for minimizing the number of SWAP operations needed to map the input circuit onto the device topology and ensure the most well-calibrated qubits are used.  Due to the importance of this stage, the preset pass managers try a few different methods to find the best layout.  Typically this involves two steps: first, try to find a \"perfect\" layout (a layout that does not require any SWAP operations), and then, a heuristic pass that tries to find the best layout to use if a perfect layout cannot be found.  There are two `Passes` typically used for this first step:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TrivialLayout`: Naively maps each virtual qubit to the same numbered physical qubit on the device (i.e., [`0`,`1`,`1`,`3`] -> [`0`,`1`,`1`,`3`]).  This is historical behavior only used in `optimzation_level=1` to try to find a perfect layout.  If it fails, `VF2Layout` is tried next.\n",
    "- `VF2Layout`: This is an `AnalysisPass` that selects an ideal layout by treating this stage as a subgraph isomorphism problem, solved by the VF2++ algorithm.  If more than one layout is found, a scoring heuristic is run to select the mapping with the lowest average error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for the heuristic stage, two passes are used by default:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DenseLayout`: Finds the sub-graph of the device with the greatest connectivity and that has the same number of qubits as the circuit  (used for optimization level 1 if there are control flow operations (such as IfElseOp) present in the circuit).\n",
    "- `SabreLayout`: This pass selects a layout by starting from an initial random layout and repeatedly running the `SabreSwap` algorithm.  This pass is only used in optimization levels 1, 2, and 3 if a perfect layout isn't found via the `VF2Layout` pass.  For more details on this algorithm, refer to the paper [arXiv:1809.02573.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02573)"

    "## Routing stage\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement a two-qubit gate between qubits that are not directly connected on a quantum device, one or more SWAP gates must be inserted into the circuit to move the qubit states around until they are adjacent on the device gate map.  Each SWAP gate represents an expensive and noisy operation to perform.  Thus, finding the minimum number of SWAP gates needed to map a circuit onto a given device is an important step in the transpilation process.  For efficiency, this stage is typically computed alongside the Layout stage by default, but they are logically distinct from one another.  The *Layout* stage selects the hardware qubits to be used, while the *Routing* stage inserts the appropriate amount of SWAP gates in order to execute the circuits using the selected layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, finding the optimal SWAP mapping is hard.  In fact, it is an NP-hard problem, and is thus prohibitively expensive to compute for all but the smallest quantum devices and input circuits.  To work around this, Qiskit uses a stochastic heuristic algorithm called `SabreSwap` to compute a good, but not necessarily optimal, SWAP mapping. The use of a stochastic method means that the circuits generated are not guaranteed to be the same over repeated runs.  Indeed, running the same circuit repeatedly results in a distribution of circuit depths and gate counts at the output.  It is for this reason that many users choose to run the routing function (or the entire `StagedPassManager`) many times and select the lowest-depth circuits from the distribution of outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take a 15-qubit GHZ circuit executed 100 times, using a “bad” (disconnected) `initial_layout`."

    "This last stage is only run if it is explicitly called for (similar to the Init stage) and does not run by default (though a method can be specified by setting the `scheduling_method` argument when calling `generate_preset_pass_manager`).  The scheduling stage is typically used once the circuit has been translated to the target basis, mapped to the device, and optimized.  These passes focus on accounting for all the idle time in a circuit.  At a high level, the scheduling pass can be thought of as explicitly inserting delay instructions to account for the idle time between gate executions and to inspect how long the circuit will be running on the backend.\n",

    "Scheduling a circuit involves two parts: analysis and constraint mapping, followed by a padding pass.  The first part requires running a scheduling analysis pass (by default this is [`ALAPSchedulingAnalysis`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.ALAPScheduleAnalysis)), which analyzes the circuit and records the start time of each instruction in the circuit into a schedule.  Once the circuit has an initial schedule, additional passes can be run to account for any timing constraints on the target backend.  Finally, a padding pass such as [`PadDelay`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.PadDelay) or [`PadDynamicalDecoupling`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.PadDynamicalDecoupling) can be executed."
