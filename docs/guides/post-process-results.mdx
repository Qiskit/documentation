# Post-process results

![All Qiskit pattern steps are shown (Map the problem, Optimize for hardware, Execute on hardware, and Post-process results). The 'Post-process results' step is emphasized.  This step uses the Qiskit SDK.](/images/qiskit-patterns/post-process-results.svg)

This final "post-process results" step of a Qiskit pattern involves stitching the outputs from
the prior step back together to obtain the desired result. This can involve a range of classical
data-processing steps such as visualizing results, readout error mitigation techniques, marginalizing
quasi-probability distributions to ascertain results on smaller sets of qubits, or post-selection on inherent
properties of the problem, such as total spin, parity, or particle conservation by removing
unphysical observables.
