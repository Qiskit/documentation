    "- Run [`batch.usage()`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/batch#usage) or [`session.usage()`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/session#usage) in `qiskit-ibm-runtime` 0.30 or later.  If using an older version of `qiskit-ibm-runtime` (>= 0.23 and < 0.30), the usage can be still be found in `session.details()[\"usage_time\"]` and `batch.details()[\"usage_time\"]`.\n",
    "- Use [`GET /sessions/{id}`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/tags/sessions#tags__sessions__operations__GetSessionDetailsExtendedController_getSessionDetails) to see usage for a specific batch or session.\n",

Note that the pages might show different usage numbers because they calculate usage differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Instances page shows real-time usage for the last 28 days (rolling), up to the current time on the current day.  The Analytics page usage is re-calculated hourly and includes the last 28 full days; that is, it shows usage from 00:00 28 days ago to today, at the top of the hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimate usage before submitting a job\n",
    "\n",
    "While getting an accurate local estimation is complicated by the extra operations done for error suppression and mitigation, you can use this baseline formula to get an approximation of estimated usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<per sub-job overhead> + (rep_delay + <circuit length>) * <num executions>`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `<per sub-job overhead>` is an overhead of approximately 2s per sub-job. This includes operations such as loading the payload into control electronics. Your primitive job may be divided into multiple sub-jobs if it is too large for the execution engine to process all at once.\n",
    "- `rep_delay` is a [user-customizable](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-execution-options-v2#rep_delay) option, and the default is given by `backend.default_rep_delay`, which is 250 microseconds on most IBM Quantum backends. Note that lowering `rep_delay` decreases the total QPU execution time, but at the expense of increased state preparation error rate; see the [Dynamic repetition rate execution](/docs/guides/repetition-rate-execution) guide for more information.\n",
    "- `<circuit length>` is the total instruction length. Each instruction takes different amount of time on the QPU, so the total length varies from circuit to circuit. A measurement, for example, can take 56 times longer than an `x` gate. `backend.target[<instruction>][<qubit>].duration` can be used to find the exact duration for each instruction. A typical circuit length is likely between 50-100 microseconds. If you are using error suppression or mitigation techniques with the primitives, extra instructions might be inserted into your circuit, which would increase the total circuit length.\n",
    "    <Admonition type=\"note\">\n",
    "    The [experimental `scheduler_timing` option](/docs/guides/visualize-circuit-timing) returns the total circuit time, but this is NOT the time used for billing.\n",
    "    </Admonition>\n",
    "- `<num executions>` is the total number of circuits times the number of shots, where the circuits are those generated after PUB elements are broadcasted.\n",
    "    - If you are using error mitigation techniques with the primitives, extra circuits might be run as part of the mitigation process, which would increase the total number of executions. Additionally, advanced error mitigation techniques such as PEA and PEC come with much higher overhead because they require running circuits for noise learning.\n",
    "    - Estimator groups qubit-wise commuting observables, which reduces the number of executions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren't using any advanced error mitigation techniques or custom `rep_delay`, you can use `2+0.00035*<num executions>` as a quick formula.\n",
