# Quantum resource management interface (QRMI)

The Quantum resource management interface (QRMI) is a vendor-agnostic library for high-performance compute (HPC) systems to access, control, and monitor the behavior of quantum computational resources. It acts as a thin middleware layer that abstracts away the complexities associated with controlling quantum resources through a set of simple APIs. Written in Rust, this interface also exposes Python and C APIs for ease of integration into nearly any computational environment.

Find the source code to build and deploy QRMI in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qrmi).

An optional `task_runner` command line tool to execute quantum payloads against quantum hardware is included in the Python package. Find the [full documentation](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qrmi/blob/main/python/qrmi/tools/task_runner/README.md) in the GitHub repository.

## Build the QRMI libraries


This section shows how to build QRMI for C and Python.

### Requirements

QRMI supports the following operating systems: 

```
AlmaLinux 9, Amazon Linux 2023, CentOS Stream 9, CentOS Stream 10, 
RedHat Enterprise Linux 8, RedHat Enterprise Linux 9, 
RedHat Enterprise Linux 10, Rocky Linux 8, Rocky Linux 9, SuSE 15, 
Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 24.04, MacOS Sequoia 15.1 or above
```

#### Compiling environment
*  [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.91 or above
* A C compiler: for example, GCC (`gcc`) on Linux and Clang (`clang-tools-extra`) for Rust unknown targets/cross compilations. QRMI is compatible with a compiler conforming to the C11 standard.
* `make/cmake` (make/cmake RPM for RHEL-compatible OS)
* `openssl` (openssl-devel RPM for RHEL-compatible OS)
* `zlib` (zlib-devel RPM for RHEL-compatible OS)
* Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 (For Python API)
  * Libraries and header files needed for Python development (python3.1x-devel RPM for RHEL-compatible OS):
    * /usr/include/python3.1x
    * /usr/lib64/libpython3.1x.so
* Doxygen (for generating C API document), depending on the OS:
  * ```dnf install doxygen``` for Linux(RHEL/CentOS/Rocky Linux etc.)
  * ```apt install doxygen``` for Linux(Ubuntu etc.)
  * ```brew install doxygen```for MacOS

#### Runtime environment
* gcc (libgcc RPM for RHEL-compatible OS)
* openssl (openssl-libs RPM for RHEL-compatible OS)
* zlib (zlib RPM for RHEL-compatible OS)
* Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 (For Python API)
    * Libraries and header files needed for Python development (python3.1x-devel RPM for RHEL-compatible OS)

Build the Rust/C API library with the following commands wherever you have saved the QRMI repository.
```shell-session
. ~/.cargo/env
cargo clean
cargo build --release
```



To build the Python package, first set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies.
```shell-session
. ~/.cargo/env
cargo clean
python3.12 -m venv ~/py312_qrmi_venv
source ~/py312_qrmi_venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Create the stub files for the Python code.
```shell-session
. ~/.cargo/env
cargo run --bin stubgen --features=pyo3
```

Lastly, build the Python wheels for distribution to your hosts.
```shell-session
source ~/py312_qrmi_venv/bin/activate
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=./target/release/maturin maturin build --release
```

The wheel is created in the `./target/release/maturin/wheels` directory. You can distribute and install on your hosts by `pip install <wheel>`.



## Logging

QRMI supports [log crate](https://crates.io/crates/log) for logging. You can find the detailed QRMI runtime logs by specifying `RUST_LOG` environment variable with the log level. Supported levels are `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` and `trace`. The default level is `warn`. 

If you specify `trace`, you can find underlying HTTP transaction logs.


```shell-session
RUST_LOG=trace <your QRMI executable>
```

Example logs:
```shell-session
[2025-08-16T03:47:38Z DEBUG request::connect] starting new connection: https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/
[2025-08-16T03:47:38Z DEBUG direct_access_api::middleware::auth] current token ...
```


## Build the API documentation

The Rust API documentation can be created by running
```shell-session
. ~/.cargo/env
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

The C API documentation can be created by using doxygen:
```shell-session
doxygen Doxyfile
```

This will create an HTML document under the `./html` directory, which you can open in a web browser. 


The Python API documentation is generated with `pydoc`. After entering the virtual environment with the QRMI packaged installed, run the following commands:
```shell-session
python -m pydoc -p 8290
Server ready at http://localhost:8290/
Server commands: [b]rowser, [q]uit
server> b
```

Then, open the following page in your browser:
```shell-session
http://localhost:8290/qrmi.html 
```

Stop the server with
```shell-session
server> q
```
