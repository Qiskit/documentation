# Initialize your Qiskit Runtime service account

Before using Qiskit Runtime, you have to initialize (instantiate) your account by submitting (loading) credentials.  These credentials can be manually submitted each time you initialize the Qiskit Runtime service, or you can save them for reuse.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
      * If you are using a public computer or other untrusted environment, follow the instructions in [Initialize the service in an untrusted environment](/docs/guides/cloud-setup-untrusted) instead.
      * Follow [these instructions](/docs/guides/cloud-setup-rest-api) if you want to connect by using the REST API instead of using Qiskit.
      * If necessary, use [this information](/docs/guides/quickstart-steps-org#firewall) to configure your firewall to enable access to the IBM Quantum API endpoints.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have completed these steps:

1. Ensure that you are a member of an IBM Cloud account.  See [Set up your IBM Cloud account](/docs/guides/cloud-setup) for instructions.
2. Create (or have access to) at least one instance. Follow these steps to verify:
    1. Log in to [IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com).
    1. Make sure that the correct account and region are selected in the account switcher in the header.
    1. If you have one or more instances shown, you're done with this step. Otherwise, [create an instance.](/docs/guides/instances#add-instance)
1. Ensure you are working in an active Python environment with the [Qiskit SDK and Qiskit Runtime installed.](/docs/guides/install-qiskit#local)
1. Activate the Python virtual environment and run Python in your virtual environment.

## Find your access credentials

1. Find your API key (also referred to as an  _API token_). From the [dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/), create your API key, then copy it to a secure location so you can use it for authentication. The token will not be visible again. Note that you can use a single API key to connect to any region.
2. Optional: Find the instance you want to use from the [Instances](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) page. Hover over its CRN, click the icon to copy it, then save it in a secure location so you can use it to identify the instance.


## Connect Qiskit with your Qiskit Runtime service instance

<Admonition type="note">
These instructions are designed for `qiskit_ibm_runtime` v0.42 or later. Some features are not enabled in earlier versions of `qiskit_ibm_runtime`. In these cases, you should always provide a value for `channel`, `token`, and `instance`, either explicitly or through a saved account.
</Admonition>

The basic code to connect Qiskit with your Qiskit Runtime service instance follows.  However, there are several different ways to customize the `QiskitRuntimeService` options, depending on your needs.  These options are described in the following sections.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel=<channel>,
            token=<your-API_KEY>, # Use the 44-character API_KEY you created and saved from the IBM Quantum Platform Home dashboard
            instance=<instance_CRN>)
```

<Admonition type="note">
The default channel is `ibm_quantum_platform`.  Because this is almost always the appropriate channel, it is not included in the examples.
</Admonition>

<span id="explicit"></span>
### Quick start path: Specify credentials explicitly

The fastest way to get a `QiskitRuntimeService` instance running is the direct instantiation method: explicitly provide the API token (key) and CRN (instance identifier) every time you need to initialize the Qiskit Runtime service. See [Find your access credentials](#access-credentials) if necessary.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService(token=<cloud_api_key>, # Use the 44-character API_KEY you created and saved from the IBM Quantum Platform Home dashboard
            instance=<instance_CRN>)
```

This path is reliable but can be tedious if you need to load the same details repeatedly. To avoid loading your credentials multiple times, if you are working in a trusted Python environment (such as on a personal laptop or workstation), you can use saved account credentials, as described in the following section.

Although the `instance` input parameter is optional, it is recommended that you always provide this information, unless you want to use a single service to work with several instances. In this situation, see the [automatic instance selection](#auto-select) section.

<span id="saved"></span>
### Quick start path: Specify saved credentials

If you have already saved your credentials, use the following code to apply your default credentials. For instructions to save credentials, see [Save your access credentials.](/docs/guides/save-credentials)

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

# run every time you need the service
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
...
```

If you named one or more sets of credentials - for example, for open and premium access - use the following code to use a set of named credentials.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

# run every time you need the service
service = QiskitRuntimeService(name="<name_of_saved_credentials>")
...
```

#### Considerations when loading saved credentials

- If you initialize a service with `token` and `name`, the `token` is ignored and the saved details from the `name` account are loaded.

    In the following example, the service loads the details from `account_A` and does not use `token_B`:
    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    service = QiskitRuntimeService(token="token_B", name="account_A")
    ```
- If you provide a `name` and an `instance` when initializing a service, the service tries to load the `name` account **and** connect to the specified `instance`. If there is any conflict, a warning is raised.

    In the following example, the service tries to load the credentials for `account_A` and use instance `CRN_B` - even if there is a different instance specified in `account_A`:
    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    service = QiskitRuntimeService(instance="CRN_B", name="account_A")
    ```
- The service tries to load the default saved account only if you don't provide a `token` or `name` when initializing a service.  However, if an `instance` is provided explicitly, the service tries to connect to that instance by using the default credentials. If there is any conflict, a warning is raised.

    In the following example, the service tries to load the default credentials and use the instance `CRN_B` - even if there is a different instance specified in the default account:
    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    service = QiskitRuntimeService(instance="CRN_B")
    ```
- If you save multiple sets of credentials but don't specify one when initializing the service and there is no default saved account, the one whose name comes last alphabetically is used.

    In the following example, the user saved accounts named "my_premium" and "my_open" but didn't mark either as the dfault.  They then initialized the service by using the following code. In this case, the "my_premium" credentials are used:
    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    service = QiskitRuntimeService()
    ```

<span id="auto-select"></span>
### Automatically select the instance

If you provide a token but **don't provide an instance CRN** when instantiating the service, `QiskitRuntimeService` authenticates to the account identified by the token and uses automatic instance selection to choose the most relevant instance for the requested task. If you have several instances available within your account, the service automatically chooses from the available instances, depending on the resource requested and these `QiskitRuntimeService` options (if set): `plans_preference`, `region`, `tags`.

- **`plans_preference`**: The types of instance plans to prioritize. For example, if [`open`] is passed in, only Open Plan instances are available. Accepted values are `open`, `premium`, `pay-as-you-go`, `flex`, and `on-prem`. If `plans_preference` is not specified, free plans are prioritized over paid plans.
- **`region`**: The instance region. Accepted values are `us-east` and `eu-de`.
- **`tags`**: The instance tags. Accepts a list of tag name strings.

<Admonition type="note">
You can set up your [saved credentials](/docs/guides/save-credentials) to automatically select an instance.
</Admonition>

The instance is found and used in this order:

1. If your account only has access to one instance, it is selected by default.
1. If saved credentials are being used and an instance was specified with the credentials, that instance is used. See [Considerations when loading saved credentials.](#considerations-when-loading-saved-credentials)
3. If your account has multiple instances that can access the requested QPU, the system uses your specified plan preferences to choose a plan and instance. For Qiskit Runtime v0.42 and later, free plans are prioritized by default.
2. If your account has access to multiple instances but only one can access the requested QPU, the instance with access is selected. If this instance is not associated with a free plan, a cost will be incurred.


#### Examples

In this example, the service searches all instances that are available to the account to find ones that can access the specified backend:

```python
service = QiskitRuntimeService(token=<your-API_KEY>)
```

In this example, the service searches all instances that are available to the account in the EU region to find ones that can access the specified backend:

```python
service = QiskitRuntimeService(token=<your-API_KEY>, region="eu-de")
```

In this example, the service searches all instances that are available to the account and are tagged as `services` to find ones that can access the specified backend:

```python
service = QiskitRuntimeService(token=<your-API_KEY>, tags=['services'])
```

In this example, the service searches all premium and open instances that are available to the account to find ones that can access the specified backend. If a backend is in both a Premium and an Open Plan instance, the Premium Plan instance is prioritized because `premium` is specified first in `plans_preference`.

```python
service = QiskitRuntimeService(token=<your-API_KEY>, plans_preference=['premium', 'open'])
```

#### Determine which instance was chosen
The selected instance is returned as a warning. Additionally, you can run `service.active_instance()` to determine the active instance.

### Local testing with Qiskit Runtime

The `QiskitRuntimeService` class can be initialized with `channel=local` to perform local simulation. In this case, authentication is not required and there is no need to provide values for `token` or `instance`. Therefore, it is not recommended that you save a local account.  Instead, you can do direct instantiation:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

# Initialize for local testing

service QiskitRuntimeService(channel="local")
```
