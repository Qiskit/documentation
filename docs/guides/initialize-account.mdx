# Initialize your Qiskit Runtime service account

Before using Qiskit Runtime, you have to initialize your account by submitting credentials.  These credentials can be submitted each time you run a job, or you can save them for reuse.

## Before you begin

Ensure that you have completed these steps:

1. If you do not already have one, set up an [IBM Cloud account.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/registration)
   <Admonition type="note">
   You can have multiple IBM Cloud accounts.  You can access any of your IBM Cloud accounts at any time from the account switcher in the header of the [IBM Quantum Platform interface](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com).

2. Create (or have access to) at least one instance.
    1. Log in to [IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) with an IBMid or Google account.  If you don't have one, you are guided through creating one.
    1. Make sure that the correct account and region are selected in the account switcher in the header, as shown in the following image.

        The region controls where your jobs are run and where the job data is kept. You can access either region by using the same API key, but you can only see and access the instances that were created in the region that you're logged in to.

    1. Go to the [IBM Quantum Platform dashboard.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) If you have one or more instances shown, you're done with this step. Otherwise, [create an instance.](/docs/guides/cloud-setup#create-instance)
