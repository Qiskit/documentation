# Understanding high availability and disaster recovery for Qiskit Runtime

High availability (HA) is the ability for a service to remain operational and accessible in the presence of unexpected failures. Disaster recovery is the process of recovering the service instance to a working state.

Qiskit Runtime is a regional service that fulfills the defined [Service Level Objectives (SLO)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/resiliency?topic=resiliency-slo) with any paid plan. For more information, see the [Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://www.ibm.com/support/customer/csol/terms/?id=i126-9268&lc=en) for IBM Cloud&reg;. For more information about the available IBM Cloud regions and data centers for Qiskit Runtime, see [Service and infrastructure availability by location.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-services_region)

## High availability architecture

### High availability features

This service is provisioned across two zones in a multi-zone region with no single point of failure. API requests are routed through a global load balancer to the HA instance nodes, each in a different zone.

If an HA instance node or zone fails, the service continues to run API requests through a global load balancer to the surviving HA instance nodes. A short delay (seconds) might occur between the outage and when the global load balancer recognizes the failure. During this time, requests might be sent to the failed instance. No noticeable degradation of service occurs during a zonal failure.

It available in the following regions:

- Washington DC (us-east)
- Frankfurt (eu-de)
