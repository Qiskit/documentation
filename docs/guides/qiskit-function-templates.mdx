# Introduction to Qiskit Function templates

[Qiskit Function templates](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates) are an open-source collection of realistic code examples that provide access to some of the latest research workflows that leverage tools like the Qiskit SDK and [Qiskit addons](/docs/guides/addons). These pre-built workflows take information from practical experiments and package them in a way that you can customize and reuse in your own research, so that you don't have to build from scratch. All templates are readily deployable to [Qiskit Serverless](/docs/guides/serverless) to easily use classical compute as part of your workflow.

There are two types of templates:

- *Template implementations*: Specialized code examples that implement advanced techniques from real-world experiments in areas like chemistry and physics.
- *Base templates*: References for developing your own original Qiskit Function. These templates highlight best-practices in interface development, code formatting, unit testing, and more.

## Template implementations

Qiskit Function template implementations are organized by application area. Currently included in the collection is a physics template for Hamiltonian simulation using the [AQC-Tensor Qiskit addon](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-aqc) and a chemistry template for electronic structure with the implicit solvent model using the [SQD Qiskit addon](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-sqd).
Resources to get started with these two templates are available at the following links:

- Electronic structure simulation with implicit solvent model: [template source files](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates/tree/main/chemistry/sqd_pcm) and [guide](/docs/guides/function-template-chemistry-workflow)
- Hamiltonian simulation: [template source files](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates/tree/main/physics/hamiltonian_simulation) and [guide](/docs/guides/function-template-hamiltonian-simulation)


## Base templates

The *base templates* are references for developing your own original Qiskit Function. They are designed to help you kickstart the development process by illustrating best practices in interface development, code formatting, I/O handling, error messages, checkpoints, unit testing, and more. The repository is exposed as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) so that the CI/CD implementation can be easily extended.

There are currently two templates: a [Circuit function template](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates/blob/main/base_templates/circuit_function_template.py) and an [Application function template](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates/blob/main/base_templates/application_function_template.py). The Circuit function template is built similarly to the [IBM Circuit function](/docs/guides/ibm-circuit-function), and the Application function template illustrates how to structure a typical application workflow.
