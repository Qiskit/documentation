# Introduction to Qiskit Function templates

[Qiskit Function templates](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates) are an open-source collection of realistic code examples that give you a detailed guide to building high-quality, utility-scale application workflows using tools like the Qiskit SDK andÂ [Qiskit addons](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides/addons). These pre-built workflows take learnings from practical experiments and package them in a way that you can customize and reuse in your own research so that you don't have to build from scratch. All templates are deployable to [Qiskit Serverless](./serverless) to simplify execution and parallelization of your workflow.

Templates are available in two varieties:

- *Template implementations*: Specialized code examples that implement advanced techniques from real-world experiments in areas like chemistry and physics.
- *Base templates*: References for developing your own original Qiskit Function that highlight best-practices in interface development, code formatting, unit testing, and more.

## Template implementations

The application template implementations are organized by application area, which currently includes a physics and chemistry application utilizing the [SQD addon](./qiskit-addons-sqd) and the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM).

For convenience, direct download links are provided for each application template directory:

- [Download Hamiltonian simulation template](https://ibm.biz/ham-sim-template)
- [Download chemistry-based SQD IEF-PCM template](https://ibm.biz/sqd-pcm-template)

The associated guide page for each of these templates can also be found here:

- [Chemistry workflow](./function-template-chemistry-workflow)
- [Hamiltonian simulation](./function-template-hamiltonian-simulation)


## Base templates

The *base templates* are references for developing your own original Qiskit Function. They are designed to help you kickstart the development process by illustrating best practices in interface development, code formatting, I/O handling, error messages, checkpointing, unit testing, and more. The repository itself is exposed as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) so that the CI/CD implementation can be easily extended.

There are currently two templates, a [circuit function template](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates/blob/main/base_templates/circuit_function_template.py) and an [application function template](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates/blob/main/base_templates/application_function_template.py). The circuit function template is built similarly to the [IBM Circuit Function](./ibm-circuit-function) and the application function template illustrates how to structure a typical application workflow.
