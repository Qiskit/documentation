# Introduction to Qiskit Function templates

The [Qiskit Function templates](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates) provide realistic examples for how to build utility-scale application workflows with Qiskit and the Qiskit addons. These prebuilt workflows are customizable for a variety of research needs and can be used instead of starting from scratch. To simplify execution and parallelization, they are easily deployable to [Qiskit Serverless](./serverless).

The templates provided are broken into two basic categories:

- *Application Templates*: Templates to build realistic research workflows.
- *Base Templates*: Basic implementation use for reference in the development process.

## Application template implementations

The application template implementations are organized by application area, which currently includes a physics and chemistry application utilizing the [SQD addon](./qiskit-addons-sqd) and the integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM).

For convenience, direct download links are provided for each application template directory:

- [Download Hamiltonian simulation template](https://ibm.biz/ham-sim-template)
- [Download chemistry-based SQD IEF-PCM template](https://ibm.biz/sqd-pcm-template)

The associated guide page for each of these templates can also be found here:

- [Chemistry workflow](./function-template-chemistry-workflow)
- [Hamiltonian simulation](./function-template-hamiltonian-simulation)


## Base templates

The *base templates* are reference implementations to kickstart the Qiskit Function development process with best-practices in interface development, code formatting, unit testing, and more. The repository itself is exposed as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository) so that the CI/CD implementation can be easily extended.

There are currently two templates, a [circuit function template](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates/blob/main/base_templates/circuit_function_template.py) and an [application function template](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-function-templates/blob/main/base_templates/application_function_template.py). The circuit function template is built similarly to the [IBM Circuit Function](./ibm-circuit-function) and the application function template provides a structure to build an application workflow.
