# Executor primitive (beta)

<Admonition type="note" title="Beta release">
The Executor primitive is currently in beta and might not be stable. You are invited to test it and provide feedback. (((how?)))
</Admonition>



    context on why it's introduced
    high level overview of the workflow and some key terminologies (e.g. box, annotations, samplex, etc)
    links to additional docs in the samplomatic repo
    some mention of the new NoiseLearnerV3 and how it fits in this picture
    also stress that it's in the early phase of development, so there is no stability guarantee. But we encourage users to test it and provide feedback
