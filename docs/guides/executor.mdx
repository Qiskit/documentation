# Executor primitive (beta)

<Admonition type="note" title="Beta release">
The Executor primitive is currently in beta and might not be stable. You are invited to test it and provide feedback. (((how?)))
</Admonition>

The Executor primitive and its supporting tools are designed for quantum information scientists to run utility-scale experiments that require more control and flexibility. Executor provides the ingredients to capture design intents on the client side, and shifts the costly generation of circuit variants to the server side, so that you can fine-tune error mitigation and other techniques without sacrificing performance. Executor's clear, composable model for execution workflows makes it easier to experiment with new techniques, reproduce results, and share methods.

In this initial release, Executor support focuses mostly on Pauli twirling, noise model learning and injection, and basis changes. Other support capabilities will be added gradually over time.
