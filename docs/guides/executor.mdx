# Executor primitive (beta)

<Admonition type="note" title="Beta release">
The Executor primitive is currently in beta and might not be stable. You are invited to test it and provide feedback. (((how?)))
</Admonition>

The Executor primitive is a response to the growing demand for finer control over advanced error-mitigation techniques. Executor shifts the generation of circuit variants to the backend, saving network costs and making the process explicit and user-definable, so that users can explore and tune mitigation techniques more directly.

While error mitigation is a leading use case, Executor provides a foundation for advanced semantics, and so it can also apply to (((future?))) methods such as estimation, hybrid execution, noise learning protocols, or shot scheduling.

The Executor primitive benefits users who want to improve the reliability of computations on noisy quantum hardware, and are interested in capabilities such as noise learning, twirling, and expectation value calculations. With Executor, users will gain a clearer and more composable model for execution workflows, making it easier to experiment with new techniques, reproduce results, and share methods.

- context on why it's introduced
- high-level overview of the workflow and some key terminologies (e.g. box, annotations, samplex, etc) - maybe dressing?
- links to additional docs in the samplomatic repo
- some mention of the new NoiseLearnerV3 and how it fits in this picture
- also stress that it's in the early phase of development, so there is no stability guarantee. But we encourage users to test it and provide feedback
