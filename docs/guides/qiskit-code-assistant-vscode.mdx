<video title="A user uses the Qiskit Code Assistant in Visual Studio Code. The user has previous imports and a function definition called get_random_linear_function, with a docstring defining what the function should do. After typing the Ctrl and . keys, the Qiskit Code Assistant autocompletes the function with the code to generate a random linear function using Numpy and Qiskit. The video ends with the user executing the code generated and getting a matrix representing a random linear function in the terminal." className="max-w-auto h-auto" controls>

## Install the VSCode extension

To install the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-code-assistant-vscode), follow these steps:

1. Launch VS Code.
1. Click the Extensions icon in the left toolbar.
1. Search for `qiskit-vscode`
1. Find "Qiskit Code Assistant" and click **Install**.

The extension is also available through the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qiskit.qiskit-vscode).

After installing, reload the extension/IDE (typically, VSCode will prompt you to do this automatically). When it's ready, you will see "Qiskit Code Assistant" listed on the bottom of the VS Code window:

## Configure extension settings

The following settings can be configured:

- To change keyboard shortcuts, open the Keyboard Shortcuts settings (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts`) and search for `qiskit-vscode`.

- You can change the IBM Quantum API token to use in the VSCode command palette. To do that, type `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`, search for `qiskit`, select the **Qiskit Code Assistant: Set IBM Quantum API token** command, and paste your IBM Quantum API token.

- [Advanced] To change the instance of the Qiskit Code Assistant Service that the extension should use, go to File > Preferences > Settings > User Settings and edit the `Qiskit Code Assistant: Url`.

## Get started using the Qiskit Code Assistant extension for VSCode


### Authentication and setup

After installing the extension, it tries to authenticate you. By default, the package tries to authenticate to IBM Quantum services with the defined Qiskit API token, and uses your token from the `QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN` environment variable or from the file `~/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json` (under the section `default-ibm-quantum`). If you need help configuring your account, follow the instructions in [Set up to use IBM Quantum Platform.](/guides/setup-channel#set-up-to-use-ibm-quantum-platform)

By default, the extension uses the `granite-8b-qiskit` model, which is listed in the Model Picker in the bottom status bar.

![The bottom status bar is shown, with `granite-8b-qiskit` listed.](/images/guides/qiskit-code-assistant/vscode-selected-model.png)

The first time you use the `granite-8b-qiskit` model, a modal opens listing some major restrictions that you should be aware of when using the model. Clicking `Accept` will accept the disclaimer and enable the model for code generation.

![The window that opens upon first use contains restrictions tha must be accepted.](/images/guides/qiskit-code-assistant/eula.png)

### Generate Code
After accepting the EULA, you can open a new file and start coding. To get a code suggestion, type `Ctrl` + `.` as shown:

![A code suggestion is shown.  The suggested code is in grey.](/images/guides/qiskit-code-assistant/vscode-inline-suggestion.png)

Press the `Tab` key to accept the model-generated suggestion or press the `ESC` key to reject it.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Tips for working with code suggestions">
- Type `Ctrl` + `.` again to generate additional suggestions.
- When a suggestion is shown, you can use `Alt/Option` + `]` and `Alt/Option + `[` to cycle forward and backward, respectively, through the suggestions (if available).
- You can hover the cursor over the suggestion to use the pop-up toolbar to cycle through the suggestions, as shown:

## Uninstall the VSCode extension

To remove the Qiskit Code Assistant from VSCode, follow these steps:

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
1. Click the Extensions icon.
1. Search for `qiskit-vscode`.
1. Click **Uninstall** for the "Qiskit Code Assistant".


## Troubleshooting

If you are not seeing the extension status bar in VSCode, check that the extension is installed and enabled under the extensions tab.

If the extension is installed and enabled, but cannot select a model, verify that your current API Token has been added and the `Qiskit Code Assistant: Url` is properly set.
