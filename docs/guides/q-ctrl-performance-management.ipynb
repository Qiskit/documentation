    "# Performance Management: A Qiskit Function by Q-CTRL Fire Opal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire Opal Performance Management makes it simple for anyone to achieve meaningful results from quantum computers at scale without needing to be quantum hardware experts. When running circuits with Fire Opal Performance Management, the function automatically applies AI-driven error suppression techniques for successfully scaling to larger problems, using more gates and qubits on the device. At the same time, reaching the correct answer takes fewer shots and requires no overhead, meaning that you save on compute time and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Management suppresses errors and increases the probability of getting the correct answer on noisy hardware. In other words, it increases the signal-to-noise ratio. The following image shows how increased accuracy enabled by Performance Management can reduce the need for additional shots in the case of a 10-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform algorithm. With only 30 shots, Q-CTRL reaches the 99% confidence threshold, whereas the default (`QiskitRuntime` Sampler, `optimization_level`=3 and `resilience_level`=1, `ibm_sherbrooke`) requires 170,000 shots. By getting the right answer faster, you save significant compute runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Visualization of the improved runtime](/images/guides/qctrl-performance-management/achieve_more.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Performance Management function can be used in place of the standard [Qiskit Runtime primitives](./primitives). Behind the scenes, multiple error suppression techniques work together to prevent errors from happening at runtime. All Fire Opal pipeline methods are pre-configured and algorithm-agnostic, meaning you always get the best performance out of the box.\n",

    "## Function description\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire Opal Performance Management has two options for execution that are similar to the Qiskit Runtime primitives, so you can easily swap in the Q-CTRL Sampler and Estimator. The general workflow for using the Performance Management function is:\n",
    "1. Define your circuit (and operators in the case of the Estimator).\n",
    "2. Run the circuit.\n",
    "3. Retrieve the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce hardware noise, Fire Opal employs a range of AI-driven error suppression techniques depicted in the following image. Error suppression works at both the gate and pulse levels to address various sources of noise and to prevent the likelihood of an error occurring. With Fire Opal, the entire pipeline is completely automated with zero need for configuration. By preventing errors, the need for expensive post-processing is eliminated.\n",

    "## Inputs and outputs\n",
    "The Sampler and Estimator inputs are meant to closely follow the implemented spec for [Qiskit Runtime V2 primitives](../migration-guides/v2-primitives). The Q-CTRL primitives accept inputs in the form of Primitive Unified Blocs (PUBs), which are tuples containing circuits and their relevant execution data. For more information on the PUB data structure, refer to the [IBM Quantum Documentation](./primitive-input-output). The main difference is that the Q-CTRL primitives accept PUBs containing basic types - for example, QASM strings, dictionaries, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Admonition type=\"caution\">Fire Opal Performance Management accepts abstract circuits, in contrast to the native Qiskit Runtime primitives, which only accept circuits that are written in the target backend’s Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). For best results, do not transpile circuits before submitting via the Performance Management function. </Admonition>\n",
