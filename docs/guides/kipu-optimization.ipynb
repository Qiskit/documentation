    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Iskay Quantum Optimizer by Kipu Quantum, you can tackle complex optimization problems using IBM&reg; quantum computers. This solver leverages Kipu's cutting-edge [bf-DCQO algorithm](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.04477) requiring only the objective function as input to automatically deliver problem solutions. It can handle optimization problems involving up to 156 qubits, enabling the use of all qubits of the IBM quantum devices. The Optimizer uses a 1-to-1 mapping between classical variables and qubits, which allows you to tackle optimization problems with up to 156 binary variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Optimizer enables the solving of unconstrained binary optimization problems. In addition to the commonly used QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulation, it also supports higher-order (HUBO) optimization problems. The solver utilizes a non-variational quantum algorithm, performing most of the computation on quantum devices.\n",

    "The following provides more details about the used algorithm and a brief guide on how to use the function, as well as benchmarking results on various problem instances of different sizes and complexities."

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Optimizer is a ready-to-use implementation of cutting-edge quantum optimization algorithms. It solves optimization problems by running highly-compressed quantum circuits on quantum hardware. This compression is achieved by introducing counterdiabatic terms into the underlying time evolution of the quantum system. The algorithm executes several iterations of hardware runs to obtain the final solutions and combines it with post-processing. These steps are seamlessly integrated into the Optimizer's workflow and are executed automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the Quantum Optimizer work?\n",
    "This section outlines the basics of the implemented bf-DCQO algorithm. An introduction to the algorithm can also be found on the [Qiskit YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33QmsXhIlpU&t=1223s)\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on the time evolution of a quantum system which is transformed over time, where the problem solution is encoded in the ground state of the quantum system at the end of the evolution. According to the [adiabatic theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_theorem), this evolution has to be slow to ensure the system remains in its ground state. Digitizing this evolution is the basis of digitized quantum adiabatic computation (DQA) and the infamous QAOA algorithm. However, the required slow evolution is not feasible for increasing problem sizes since it results in an increasing circuit depth. By using counterdiabatic protocols, you can suppress unwanted excitations occurring during short evolution times while remaining in the ground state. Here, digitizing this shorter evolution time results in quantum circuits with shorter depth and fewer entangling gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuits of the bf-DCQO algorithms typically use up to ten times fewer entangling gates than DQA, and three to four times fewer entangling gates than standard QAOA implementations. Because of the smaller number of gates, fewer errors occur during the circuit execution on hardware. Hence, the optimizer does not require using techniques like error suppression or error mitigation. Implementing them in future versions can enhance the solution quality even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the bf-DCQO algorithm uses iterations, it is non-variational. After each iteration of the algorithm, the distribution of states is measured. The obtained distribution is used to calculate a so-called bias-field. The bias-field allows starting the next iteration from an energy state near the previously found solution. In this way, the algorithm moves with each iteration to solutions of lower energy. Typically, approximately ten iterations are sufficient to converge to a solution, in total requiring a much lower number of iterations than variational algorithms, which is on the order of  approximately 100 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizer combines the bf-DCQO algorithm with classical post-processing. After measuring the distribution of states, a local search is performed. During the local search, the bits of the measured solution are randomly flipped. After the flip, the energy of the new bitstring is evaluated. If the energy is lower, the bitstring is kept as the new solution. The local search only scales linearly with the number of qubits; hence, it is computationally cheap. Since the post-processing corrects local bitflips, it compensates for bit-flip errors that often are the result of hardware imperfections and readout errors.\n",
