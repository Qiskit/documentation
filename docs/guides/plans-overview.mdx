# Overview of available plans

<Admonition type="note">
This documentation is relevant to the new IBM Quantum&reg; Platform. If you need the previous version, return to the [IBM Quantum Platform Classic documentation.](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/setup-channel#ibm-cloud)
</Admonition>

IBM Quantum Platform has Open (free access) and Premium (enterprise subscription) plans, as described below. See [IBM Quantum access plans](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/access-plans) for full details.

If you want access to multiple plans, you can create multiple instances and assign different plans to them.  For example, you can have an Open Plan instance and a Standard Plan instance.

## Open Plan

Run your quantum circuits on the world's best QPUs for free (up to 10 minutes quantum time per 28-day rolling window). You can track your usage on the [Platform dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) and the [Workloads](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/workloads) pages.

This plan is recommended for those who are learning quantum computing and exploring IBM quantum technology.

## Standard (Pay-as-you-go) Plan

Run quantum circuits on the world's best QPUs and pay only for the quantum time you use.

This plan is recommended for those who are performing quantum utility research projects and testing business models with flexible access.

## Premium Plan

Run quantum circuits on the world's best QPUs using an enterprise quantum time subscription. Additionally, some functionality, such as [Qiskit Functions](functions) and [Qiskit Transpiler as a Service](qiskit-transpiler-service),  is available only to Premium Plan users.

This plan is recommended for those who want to execute a strategic quantum roadmap and develop quantum algorithms and applications at scale.
