# View the cost

At any time, you can see how much cost has been incurred by workloads associated with an instance.

## View instance cost

To determine how much an instance has been used, from the [Instances page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances), click the instance to open its details page. The **Instance usage** value shows the total usage since the instance was created.  You can click the link associated with **Billing overview** for full cost and billing details.

## View workload usage

To determine how much usage a specific workload incurred, open the [Workloads page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/workloads) and view view the "Usage" column for the workload.
