# View the cost

At any time, you can see how much cost has been incurred by workloads associated with an instance.

## View instance cost

To determine how much an instance has been used, from the [Instances page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances), click the instance to open its details page. You can click the link associated with **Billing overview** for full cost and billing details.

**Instance usage** reports a different value, depending on the type of plan the instance is associated with:

- For Premium and Open plans, this is the real-time usage for the last 28 days (rolling), up to the current time on the current day.
- For Pay-As-You-Go plans, this is all usage from the time the instance was created.
- For Flex plans, this is the usage from the beginning of the contract. 

## View workload usage

To determine how much usage a specific workload incurred, open the [Workloads page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/workloads) and view view the "Usage" column for the workload.
