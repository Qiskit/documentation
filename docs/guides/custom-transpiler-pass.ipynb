    "The Qiskit SDK lets you create custom transpilation passes and run them in the `PassManager` object or add them to a `StagedPassManager`. Here we will demonstrate how to write a  transpiler pass, focusing on building a pass that performs [Pauli twirling](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606161) on the noisy quantum gates in a quantum circuit. This example uses the DAG, which is the object manipulated by the `TransformationPass` type of pass."

    "Before building a pass, it is important to introduce the internal representation of quantum circuits in Qiskit, the [directed acyclic graph (DAG)](../api/qiskit/qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit) (see [this tutorial](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/rustworkx/tutorial/dags.html) for an overview).  To follow these steps, install the [`graphviz` library](https://graphviz.org/download/) for the DAG plotting functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Qiskit, within the transpilation stages, circuits are represented using a DAG.  In general, a DAG is composed of *vertices* (also known as \"nodes\") and directed *edges* that connect pairs of vertices in a particular orientation.  This representation is stored using `qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit` objects that are composed of invididual `DagNode` objects.  The advantage of this representation over a pure list of gates (that is, a *netlist*) is that the flow of information between operations is explicit, making it easier to make transformation decisions.\n",

    "Transpiler passes are classified either as an [`AnalysisPass`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.AnalysisPass) or a [`TransformationPass`](../api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.TransformationPass). Passes in general work with the [DAG](../api/qiskit/qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit) and the `property_set`, a dictionary-like object for storing properties determined by analysis passes. Analysis passes work with both the DAG and its `property_set`.  They cannot modify the DAG, but can modify the `property_set`.  This contrasts with transformation passes, which do modify the DAG, and can read (but not write to) `property_set`.  For example, transformation passes translate a circuit to its [ISA](./transpile#instruction-set-architecture) or perform routing passes to insert SWAP gates where needed."

    "## Create a `PauliTwirl` transpiler pass\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example constructs a transpiler pass that adds Pauli twirls. [Pauli twirling](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0606161) is an error suppression strategy that randomizes how qubits experience noisy channels, which we assume to be two-qubit gates in this example (because they are much more error-prone than single-qubit gates). The Pauli twirls do not affect the two-qubit gates' operation. They are chosen such that those applied *before* the two-qubit gate (to the left) are countered by those applied *after* the two-qubit gate (to the right). In this sense, the two-qubit operations are identical, but the way they are performed is different. One benefit of Pauli twirling is that it turns coherent errors into stochastic errors, which can be improved by averaging more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transpiler passes act on the [DAG](../api/qiskit/qiskit.dagcircuit.DAGCircuit), so the important method to override is `.run()`, which takes the DAG as input. Initializing pairs of Paulis as shown preserves the operation of each two-qubit gate. This is done with the helper method `build_twirl_set`, which goes through each two-qubit Pauli (as obtained from `pauli_basis(2)`) and finds the other Pauli that preserves the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the DAG, use the `op_nodes()` method to return all of its nodes. The DAG can also be used to collect runs, which are sequences of nodes that run uninterrupted on a qubit. These can be collected as single-qubit runs with `collect_1q_runs`, two-qubit runs with `collect_2q_runs`, and runs of nodes where the instruction names are in a namelist with `collect_runs`.  The `DAGCircuit` has many methods for searching and traversing a graph.  One commonly used method is `topological_op_nodes`, which provides the nodes in a dependency ordering. Other methods such as `bfs_successors` are used primarily to determine how nodes interact with subsequent operations on a DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example, we want to replace each node, representing an instruction, with a subcircuit built as a mini DAG. The mini DAG has a two-qubit quantum register added to it.  Operations are added to the mini DAG by using `apply_operation_back`, which places the `Instruction` on the mini DAG's output (whereas `apply_operation_front` would place it on the mini DAG's input). The node is then substituted by the mini DAG by using `substitute_node_with_dag`, and the process continues over each instance of `CXGate` and `ECRGate` in the DAG (corresponding to the two-qubit basis gates on IBM&reg; backends)."
