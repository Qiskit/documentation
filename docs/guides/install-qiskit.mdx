Whether you will work locally or in a cloud environment, the first step for all users is to install Qiskit. For those wanting to run on a real quantum processing unit (QPU), your next step is to choose one of two channels in order to access IBM&reg; QPUs: IBM Quantum Platform or IBM Cloud&reg;.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Upgrade from Qiskit 0.x to Qiskit 1.0 and beyond">
  (If you are installing Qiskit for the first time, skip ahead to the [Install and set up](#local) section. This notice is relevant only to users who have installed Qiskit previously.)

  **For those upgrading from version 0.x to 1.0 or later**: note that because Qiskit v1.0 uses a new packaging structure, you **cannot** use `pip install -U qiskit` to upgrade from any Qiskit 0.x version to 1.0.

  See the [Qiskit 1.0 migration guide](/migration-guides/qiskit-1.0) for details and instructions.

  Future updates starting with Qiskit 1.0 will allow for in-place upgrades.

## Install the Qiskit SDK and the Qiskit Runtime client


1. Install Python. Check the "Programming Language" section on the [Qiskit PyPI project page](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/) to determine which Python versions are supported by the most recent release. For download instructions, see the [Python Beginners Guide.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

    It is recommended that you use [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) to separate Qiskit from other applications.

    <Admonition type = "note">
    These instructions use the standard Python distribution from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/). However, you can use other Python distributions, such as [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) or [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/), along with other dependency management workflows like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

    </summary>
    A virtual Python environment is an isolated space to work with Python for a specific purpose — so you can install whatever packages you wish, and set up libraries, dependencies, and so on, without affecting the "base" Python environment on your machine.

    One important advantage of a virtual environment is that if your Python environment becomes corrupted somewhere along the way, you can easily delete the virtual environment and start over!

    Choose a preferred location in which to store information about your virtual environments. Commonly they're stored in a directory named `.venv` within a user's home directory.
    </details>

    First, create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it.

        <OperatingSystemTabs>
          <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

          <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

          <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
            ```text
            python3 -m venv c:\path\to\virtual\environment
            ```
          </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

    Next, activate your new environment.

         <OperatingSystemTabs>
           <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

           <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

           <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
             ```text
             c:\path\to\virtual\environment\Scripts\Activate.ps1
             ```
           </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

1. [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) if it's not already installed in your environment. Pip is a Python package manager that you use to install Qiskit and other Python packages. Use `pip list` to see what is in your virtual environment. In most Python environments, pip is already installed.

1. Install the Qiskit SDK. If you plan to run jobs on quantum hardware, also install Qiskit Runtime.

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit
      ```

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
      ```

      If you intend to use visualization functionality or Jupyter notebooks, it is recommended to install Qiskit with the extra visualization support (`'qiskit[visualization]'`).

      <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="default" label="Default">

      ```shell
      pip install qiskit[visualization]
      ```
      </TabItem>

      <TabItem value="zsh" label="zsh">
      ```shell
      pip install 'qiskit[visualization]'
      ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>


1. If you want to run a Jupyter notebook with the Qiskit packages you just installed, you will need to install Jupyter in your environment.

      ```shell
      pip install jupyter
      ```
    Then open your notebook as follows:

      ```shell
      jupyter notebook path/to/notebook.ipynb
      ```

If you are planning to work locally and use simulators built into Qiskit, then your installation is done. If you want to run jobs on IBM QPUs, next [select an access channel](setup-channel) and finish your setup.

<Admonition type="note" title="Stay current with the latest versions">
    Periodically check the [Qiskit release notes](../api/qiskit/release-notes) and the [Qiskit Runtime release notes](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes) to see new releases. We recommend frequently updating your requirements for `qiskit` and `qiskit-ibm-runtime` by, for example, changing the versions in `requirements.txt` to the latest versions, then running `pip install -r requirements.txt` or the appropriate command for your dependency management workflow.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>
    "No Module 'qiskit'" error with Jupyter Notebook
  </summary>
  If you used ``pip install qiskit`` and set up your virtual environment in
  Anaconda, then you may get the ``No Module 'qiskit'`` error when you run a tutorial
  in Jupyter Notebook. If you have not installed Qiskit or set up your
  virtual environment, you can follow the [installation](#qiskit-install) steps.

  The error is caused when trying to import the Qiskit package in an
  environment where Qiskit is not installed. If you launched Jupyter Notebook
  from the Anaconda-Navigator, it is possible that Jupyter Notebook is running
  in the base (root) environment, instead of in your virtual
  environment. Choose a virtual environment in the Anaconda-Navigator from the
  **Applications on** dropdown menu. In this menu, you can see
  all of the virtual environments within Anaconda, and you can
  select the environment where you have Qiskit installed to launch Jupyter
  Notebook.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Compilation errors during installation
  </summary>
  Qiskit depends on a number of other open-source Python packages, which
  are automatically installed when doing ``pip install qiskit``. Depending on
  your system's platform and Python version, it is possible that a particular
  package does not provide pre-built binaries for your system. You can refer
  to [Operating system support](#operating-system-support) for a list of platforms supported by Qiskit, some
  of which may need an extra compiler. In cases where there are
  no precompiled binaries available, ``pip`` will attempt to compile the package
  from source, which in turn might require some extra dependencies that need to
  be installed manually.

  If the output of ``pip install qiskit`` contains similar lines to:

  ```
  Failed building wheel for SOME_PACKAGE
  ...
  build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.5/_openssl.c:498:30: fatal error
  compilation terminated.
  error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
  ```

  please check the documentation of the package that failed to install (in the
  example code, ``SOME_PACKAGE``) for information on how to install the libraries
  needed for compiling from source.

## Operating system support

Qiskit strives to support as many operating systems as possible, but due to limitations in available testing resources and operating system availability, not all operating systems can be supported. Operating system support for Qiskit is broken into three tiers with different levels of support for each tier. For platforms outside these, such as FreeBSD or WebAssembly (WASI), Qiskit may still be installable, but it is not tested and you will have to build Qiskit (and likely Qiskit’s dependencies) from source.

Additionally, Qiskit only supports the CPython implementation of the Python language. Running with other Python interpreters such as PyPy is not supported.

<details>
  <summary>
    Tier 1
  </summary>
  Tier 1 operating systems are fully tested as part of the development processes to ensure any proposed change will function correctly. Pre-compiled binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the release process. Typically, as long as there is a functioning Python environment installed, Qiskit can be installed on these operating systems without needing to install further dependencies.

  Tier 1 operating systems:

  - Linux x86_64 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification).
  - macOS x86_64 (10.12 or later)
  - macOS ARM64 (11.0 or newer)
  - Windows 64-bit (Windows 10 and later supported)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Tier 2
  </summary>
  Tier 2 operating systems are not tested as part of development process. However, pre-compiled binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the release process and these packages can be expected to be installed with just a functioning Python environment.

  Tier 2 operating systems:

  - Linux AArch64 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Tier 3
  </summary>
  Tier 3 operating systems are not tested as part of the development process. Pre-compiled binaries are built and published to PyPI as part of the release process but are not tested. They may not be installable with just a functioning Python environment and might require a C/C++ compiler or additional programs to build dependencies from source as part of the installation process. Support for these operating systems are best effort only.

  Tier 3 operating systems:

  - Linux ppc64le (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/)packaging specification)
  - Linux s390x (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
  - Linux i686 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
  - Windows 10 32-bit
