# Open source

Since 2016, IBM Quantum&reg; has harnessed the power of community-driven innovation by making quantum computing resources accessible to everyone via the cloud.
This groundbreaking initiative includes open-sourcing key parts of the quantum software stack and introducing Qiskit, a versatile quantum computing framework.
Today, Qiskit is the most popular quantum framework, thanks in part to its vibrant community.
The Qiskit community is a dynamic and welcoming group of developers, scientists, and enthusiasts collaborating to advance software, research, education, and business through quantum computing.
By making this transformative technology open and accessible, we accelerate innovation and discover new applications.

As quantum technology evolves, contributions from the open-source [Qiskit ecosystem](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/ecosystem) projects and developers are crucial in shaping its future.

By joining the Qiskit community, you can participate in the development of quantum technologies.
Whether you are a seasoned quantum programmer or taking the first step on your quantum journey, Qiskit provides the support and inspiration needed to push boundaries.
We welcome all kinds of contributions, from code in pull requests to community support on [Slack](https://qisk.it/join-slack), ensuring everyone can play a role in advancing quantum technology.
