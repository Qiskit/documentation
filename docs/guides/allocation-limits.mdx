# Set instance allocation limits

Premium accounts are alloted a certain amount of time.  Because each account can have many instances, setting allocation limits helps you control which instances are allowed to consume that time.

The time that you allocate is used by the fair-share algorithm and determines the priority in the queue, based on usage of all QPUs over a rolling time window of 28 days.

Optionally you can set this time allocation as a limit for the instance.

Setting allocations and limits is optional.  If none are set for your instances, the [fair-share scheduler](/fair-share-queue) prioritizes workloads from instances with lower usage, and your account is still limited to its overall time allotment.

You can set the allocation when creating the instance.  Alternatively, you can view and change allocated time on the [instances page.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances)

## What happens when the limit is reached

The following happens when an instance reaches its limit:

- Active workloads continure running.
- Pending jobs remain queued.
- No workloads are canceled.
- Collaborators can submit new workloads, which will remain queued until more time is available.
