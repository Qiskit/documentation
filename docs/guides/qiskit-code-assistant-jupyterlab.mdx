# Use the Qiskit Code Assistant in JupyterLab

Learn how to install, use, configure, and uninstall the official Qiskit Code Assistant extension in JupyterLab.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
    - This is an experimental feature available only to IBM Quantum&trade; Premium Plan users.
    - The Qiskit Code Assistant is in preview release status and is subject to change.
    - If you have feedback or want to contact the developer team, use the [Qiskit Slack Workspace channel](https://qiskit.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07LYA6PL83) or the related public GitHub repositories.

## Install the JupyterLab extension
To install the [JupyterLab extension](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-code-assistant-jupyterlab), run the following command from a terminal:
```sh
pip install qiskit-code-assistant-jupyterlab
```

After installing the extension, start JupyterLab:

```sh
jupyter lab
```

The extension loads automatically and is listed on the bottom of the JupyterLab window.

For help working with JupyterLab, refer to the [JupyterLab documentation.](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Configure extension settings

It is recommended that you edit the following JupyterLab settings by going Settings > Settings Editor:

- Click **Inline Completer**, find "Show widget" and choose **Always**.  This means that the the inline completer widget will always be shown so you can cycle through and select a completion item.

- Click **Code Completion** and increase the value for "Default timeout for a provider." to `10000` or 10 seconds. The default value is 1 second, but the Qiskit Code Assistant API might take longer than this to find a suggstion. This setting only applies to the standard context menu that is invoked with `Tab`. The inline completer has a default of 10 seconds.

Other settings you might want to change:

- Keyboard shortcuts can be changed from Settings > Settings Editor > Keyboard Shortcuts.

- You can change the IBM Quantum API token to use in the JupyterLab command palette. To do that, type `Alt + Shift + C`, search for `qiskit`, select the **Qiskit Code Assistant: Set IBM Quantum API token** command, and paste in your token.

- [Advanced] To change the instance of the Qiskit Code Assistant Service that the extension should use, edit the Qiskit Code Assistant `serviceUrl` setting.

- [Advanced] Keyboard shortcuts can be changed by searching for `completer` in the Keyboard Shortcuts settings (Settings > Settings Editor > Keyboard Shortcuts) and adding new shortcuts for the relevant commands.

## Get started using the Qiskit Code Assistant extension for JupyterLab

### Authentication and setup

After installing the extension, it tries to authenticate you. By default, the package tries to authenticate to IBM Quantum services with the defined Qiskit API token, and uses your token from the `QISKIT_IBM_TOKEN` environment variable or from the file `~/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json` (under the section `default-ibm-quantum`). If you need help configuring your account, follow the instructions in [Set up to use IBM Quantum Platform.](/guides/setup-channel#set-up-to-use-ibm-quantum-platform)

By default, the extension uses the `granite-8b-qiskit` model, which is listed in the Model Picker in the bottom status bar.

![The bottom status bar is shown, with `granite-8b-qiskit` listed.](/images/guides/qiskit-code-assistant/vscode-selected-model.png)

The first time you use the `granite-8b-qiskit` model a modal opens, listing some major restrictions that you should be aware of when using the model. Clicking `Accept` will accept the disclaimer and enable the model for code generation.

![The window that opens upon first use contains restrictions tha must be accepted.](/images/guides/qiskit-code-assistant/eula.png)

### Generate Code
In JupyterLab, there are two ways to use the code autocompletion: inline or in a context menu.

Inline autocomplettion can be triggered by using the following key strokes:

- `Alt .` or `Alt \` runs autocomplete at the current cursor location.
- `Alt [` and `Alt ]` can be used to cycle through the list of suggestions if there are
  more than one.
- `Alt Tab` or `Alt END` accepts the suggested code and inserts it at the current
  cursor location.

Additionally, after the assistant runs, you can use the buttons on the widget to cycle or accept the suggestion:

<Admonition type="note">
The service can sometimes take a few seconds to retrun a suggestion, you can see when the service is working by checking the status bar.
</Admonition>

Jupyterlab also includes a traditional suggestion context menu. Use `Tab` to run and display the context menu.

The context menu includes suggestions from JupyterLab in addition to the Qiskit Code Assistant suggestions. The context menu also sanitizes and trims the suggestions, making it less useful for reviewing the code suggestion before inserting it.

## Uninstall the JupyterLab extension


To remove the Qiskit Code Assistant extension from JupyterLab, run:

```bash
pip uninstall qiskit_code_assistant_jupyterlab
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are seeing the frontend extension but it is not working, check that the server
extension is enabled:

```bash
jupyter server extension list
```

If the server extension is installed and enabled, but you are not seeing the frontend
extension, check the frontend extension is installed:

```bash
jupyter labextension list
```


## Contribute to the JupyterLab extension

The code for this extension is publicly available and open source. Check it out in [github.](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-code-assistant-jupyterlab)
