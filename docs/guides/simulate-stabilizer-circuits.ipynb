    "Stabilizer circuits, also known as Clifford circuits, are an important restricted class of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated classically. There are several equivalent ways to define stabilizer circuits. One definition is that a stabilizer circuit is a quantum circuit that consists solely of the following gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [CX](../api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CXGate)\n",
    "- [Hadamard](../api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.HGate)\n",
    "- [S](../api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.SGate)\n",
    "- [Measurement](../api/qiskit/circuit#qiskit.circuit.Measure)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using Hadamard and S, we can construct any Pauli rotation gate ([$R_x$](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RXGate), [$R_y$](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RYGate), and [$R_z$](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RZGate)) that has an angle contained in the set $\\{0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\}$ (up to global phase), so we can include these gates in the definition as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stabilizer circuits are important to the study of quantum error correction. Their classical simulability also makes them useful for verifying the output of quantum computers. For example, suppose you want to execute a quantum circuit that uses 100 qubits on a quantum computer. How do you know that the quantum computer is behaving correctly? A quantum circuit on 100 qubits is beyond the reach of brute-force classical simulation. By modifying your circuit so that it becomes a stabilizer circuit, you can run circuits on the quantum computer that have a similar structure to your desired circuit, but which you can simulate on a classical computer. By checking the output of the quantum computer on the stabilizer circuits, you can gain confidence that it is behaving correctly on the non-stabilizer circuits as well. See [*Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06096-3) for an example of this idea in practice.\n",

    "Because the cost of simulating quantum circuits scales exponentially with the number of qubits, such a large circuit would generally exceed the capabilities of even a high-performance simulator like Qiskit Aer. Classical simulation of generic quantum circuits becomes infeasible when the number of qubits exceeds roughly 50 to 100 qubits. However, note that the efficient_su2 circuit is parameterized by angles on $R_y$ and $R_z$ gates. If all of these angles are contained in the set $\\{0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\}$, then the circuit is a stabilizer circuit, and it can be efficiently simulated!\n",
