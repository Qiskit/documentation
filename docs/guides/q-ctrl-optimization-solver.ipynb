    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Fire Opal Optimization Solver, you can solve utility-scale optimization problems on quantum hardware without requiring quantum expertise. Simply input the high-level problem definition, and the Solver takes care of the rest. The entire workflow is noise-aware and leverages [Fire Opal's Performance Management](/docs/guides/q-ctrl-performance-management) under the hood. The Solver consistently delivers accurate solutions to classically challenging problems, even at full-device scale on the largest IBM&reg; QPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solver is flexible and can be used to solve combinatorial optimization problems defined as objective functions or arbitrary graphs. Problems do not have to be mapped to device topology. Both unconstrained and constrained problems are solvable, given that constraints can be formulated as penalty terms. The examples included in this guide demonstrate how to solve an unconstrained and a constrained utility-scale optimization problem using different Solver input types. The first example involves a Max-Cut problem defined on a 156-node, 3-Regular graph, while the second example tackles a 50-node Minimum Vertex Cover problem defined by a cost function.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Solver fully optimizes and automates the entire algorithm, from error suppression at the hardware level to efficient problem mapping and closed-loop classical optimization. Behind the scenes, the Solver's pipeline reduces errors at every stage, enabling the enhanced performance required to meaningfully scale. The underlying workflow is inspired by the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm. For a detailed summary of the full Optimization Solver workflow, refer to [the published manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01743).\n",
