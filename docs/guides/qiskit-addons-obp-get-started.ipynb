    "When you prepare a quantum workload with operator backpropagation (OBP), first you must make a selection of \"circuit slices\", and second, you should specify a truncation threshold or \"error budget\" to remove terms with small coefficients in the backpropagated operator as well as set an upper bound to the overall size of the backpropagated operator. During backpropagation, the number of terms in the operator of an $N$-qubit circuit will approach $4^N$ quickly in the worst-case scenario. This guide demonstrates the steps involved in applying OBP to a quantum workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main component of the `qiskit-addons-obp` package is the `backpropagate()` function. It ingests arguments for the final observable to reconstruct, a set of circuit slices to compute classically, and, optionally, a `TruncationErrorBudget` or `OperatorBudget` to provide constraints on the truncation that is done. Once these are specified, the classically computed backpropagated operator $O'$ is calculated iteratively by applying the gates from each slice, $s$, in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ O'^{(s)} = \\mathcal{U}_{S-s+1}^\\dagger O'^{(s-1)} \\mathcal{U}_{S-s+1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the total number of slices and $\\mathcal{U}_{s}$ represents a single slice of the circuit. This example uses the `qiskit-addons-utils` package to prepare the circuit slices as well as generate the example circuit.\n",
