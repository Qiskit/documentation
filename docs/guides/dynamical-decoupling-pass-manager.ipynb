    "\n",
    "Dynamical decoupling works by adding pulse sequences (known as _dynamical decoupling sequences_) to idle qubits to flip them around the Bloch sphere, which cancels the effect of noise channels, thereby suppressing decoherence. These pulse sequences are similar to refocusing pulses used in nuclear magnetic resonance. For a full description, see [A Quantum Engineer's Guide to Superconducting Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06560).\n",

    "Because the `PadDynamicalDecoupling` pass only operates on scheduled circuits and involves gates that are not necessarily basis gates of our target, you will need the [`ALAPScheduleAnalysis`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.ALAPScheduleAnalysis) and [`BasisTranslator`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.BasisTranslator) passes as well.\n",

First, transpile the circuit to the backend because dynamical decoupling pulses need to be added after the circuit has been transpiled and scheduled. Dynamical decoupling often works best when there is a lot of idle time in the quantum circuits - that is, there are qubits that are not being used while others are active. This is the case in this circuit because the two-qubit `ecr` gates are applied sequentially in this ansatz."
