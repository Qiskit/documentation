# Invite users and manage their access
<Admonition type="note">
This documentation is relevant to the new IBM Quantum&reg; Platform. If you need the previous version, return to the [IBM Quantum Platform Classic documentation.](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/admin/)
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Before you begin">
Create your account's instances before you invite users. For every instance you create through IBM Quantum Platform, an associated [access group](/guides/access-groups) is automatically generated. When you invite users to an instance, you can assign them to a specific instance's access group as part of the invitation process.

## Invite users to your organization's account

<Admonition note="tip" title="Users with IBM Cloud accounts">
If a user has a previously existing IBM Cloud account, follow the instructions in the [Manage IBM Cloud users](/guides/manage-cloud-users) section.
</Admonition>

1. First, ensure you have the correct account and region selected in the account and region switchers in the header.
1. Select [*Access management*](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/users) from the main menu.
1. On the Users tab, click  "Invite user".
1. Enter the users' email addresses and optionally assign the invited users to access groups.
1. The user will receive an invitation to create an IBM Cloud account and join the instance. After they accept the invitation, they will see a new account in their account switcher at the top of the IBM Quantum Platform page.


## Manage a user's access groups

To change a user's access groups, go to [*Access management*](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/users) from the main menu. Click the overflow menu at the end of the user's row and select *Manage access*. On the modal that opens, select the access groups the user should belong to.

## Remove a user

To remove a user from an instance, go to [*Access management*](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/users) from the main menu. Click the overflow menu at the end of the user's row, and select *Delete*. You are prompted to confirm the deletion.

<Admonition type="Note">
If a user is removed from an instance, their workloads and the associated results are no longer visible to them. Other users in the same instance can still access the workload data and results.
