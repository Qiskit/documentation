    "Abstract circuits need to be transpiled because QPUs have a limited set of basis gates and cannot execute arbitrary operations. The transpiler's function is to change arbitrary circuits so that they can run on a specified QPU.  This is done by translating the circuits to the supported basis gates, and by introducing SWAP gates as needed, so that the circuit's connectivity matches that of the QPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in [Transpile with pass managers](transpile-with-pass-managers), you can create a [pass manager](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.PassManager) using the [`generate_preset_pass_manager`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.generate_preset_pass_manager#qiskit.transpiler.generate_preset_pass_manager) function and pass a circuit or list of circuits to its [run](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.PassManager#run) method to transpile them. You can call `generate_preset_pass_manager` passing only the optimization level and backend, choosing to use the defaults for all other options, or you can pass additional arguments to the function to fine-tune the transpilation.\n",
