# Overview to execution tools

Execution tools assist with running your circuits on hardware. The ISA circuits produced during transpilation can be executed using either a Sampler or Estimator primitive from Qiskit Runtime, initialized locally on your computer, from a cluster, other heterogeneous compute environment. These can be executed in a batch, which allows parallel transpilation for classical computational efficiency - or a session, which allows iterative tasks to be implemented efficiently without queuing delays. Note: Open Plan users cannot submit session jobs.

Depending on whether you are using the Sampler or Estimator primitive, the outcome of this step will be different. If using Sampler, the output will be per-shot measurements in the form of bitstrings. If using Estimator, the output will be expectation values of observables corresponding to physical quantities or cost functions.
