description: How to monitor or cancel a job submitted to IBM Quantum Platform or IBM Quantum on IBM Cloud

# Monitor or cancel a job

Jobs are listed on the Jobs page for your quantum service channel:

*   IBM Cloud&reg; channel: From the IBM Cloud console quantum [Instances page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/instances), click the name of your instance, then click the Jobs tab.
*   IBM Quantum&trade; channel: In IBM Quantum Platform, open the [Jobs page](https://quantum.ibm.com/jobs).

## Monitor a job

Use the job instance to check the job status or retrieve the results by calling the appropriate command:

|                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| job.result()                  | Review job results immediately after the job completes. Job results are available after the job completes. Therefore, job.result() is a blocking call until the job completes.                               |
| job.job\_id()                 | Return the ID that uniquely identifies that job. Retrieving the job results at a later time requires the job ID. Therefore, it is recommended that you save the IDs of jobs you might want to retrieve later. |
| job.status()                  | Check the job status.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| job = service.job(\<job\_id>) | Retrieve a job you previously submitted. This call requires the job ID.                                                                                                                                      |

<span id="retrieve-later"></span>
## Retrieve job results at a later time

Call `service.job(\<job\_id>)` to retrieve a job you previously submitted. If you donâ€™t have the job ID, or if you want to retrieve multiple jobs at once; including jobs from retired QPUs (quantum processing units), call `service.jobs()` with optional filters instead. See [QiskitRuntimeService.jobs](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.QiskitRuntimeService#jobs).

<Admonition type="note" title="Deprecated provider packages">
  `service.jobs()` also returns jobs run from the deprecated `qiskit-ibm-provider` package. Jobs submitted by the older (also deprecated) `qiskit-ibmq-provider` package are no longer available.
</Admonition>

### Example

This example returns the 10 most recent runtime jobs that were run on `my_backend`:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

# Initialize the account first.
service = QiskitRuntimeService()

service.jobs(backend_name=my_backend)
```

## Cancel a job

You can cancel a job from the IBM Quantum Platform dashboard either on the Jobs page or the details page for a specific job. Click the menu with three vertical dots (at the end of the row on the Jobs page, or the top of the page on the Job details page), and select Cancel.

In Qiskit, use `job.cancel()` to cancel a job.
