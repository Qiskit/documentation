# Calibration jobs

## What is calibrated?

Multiple aspects of the QPU are affected by the many different calibrations that IBM&reg; runs daily and hourly.

### Device calibrations

Calibrations for qubit and gate parameters are conducted on an as-needed basis. Regularly scheduled diagnostic monitoring experiments, interleaved with user jobs, determine when calibrations are needed. These calibrations can occur at any time during the day, based on device performance. Benchmark-measuring experiments that are reported to Qiskit are run daily and interleave with user jobs.

*   **Single-qubit calibrations**

    The frequency, pulse amplitudes, and “DRAG” parameter of each qubit are calibrated on an as-needed basis.

*   **Single-qubit benchmarking**

    The T1/T2 coherence times and measurement error rates are measured, and randomized benchmarking is run in batches of non-adjacent qubits. These benchmarks are measured on a daily basis, with the exception of measurement error, which is reported when readout angle calibrations are performed as well. 

*   **Two-qubit gate calibrations and benchmarking**

    The amplitude and phase of each pulse is calibrated, and randomized benchmarking in batches of well-separated gates of similar length is run. These benchmarks are measured on a daily basis.

### Hourly calibrations/monitoring

These calibrations attempt to run hourly and last 2-3 minutes. They are interleaved with jobs from external users and will try to run in as close to one-hour intervals as possible. They include the following:

*   Readout angle of each qubit
*   Stability checks

This ensures proper state discrimination.

The system health is also monitored by using a quick test to confirm all single- and two-qubit gates are working at a basic level. This ensures the proper operation of gates and allows us to automatically close the queue if we notice a serious system failure.

## Why are calibrations run?

Calibrations ensure that the QPUs are stable and return accurate results. It also allows IBM to find and resolve any system failures as soon as possible. They also provide users with the most up-to-date error rates and coherence times, allowing them to make better choices when choosing which qubits to use or how to compile their circuits.

## Multiple circuits in the same job

**If I have multiple circuits in the same job, is it possible for some of those circuits to run under a different calibration?**

No; since the circuits are bundled into a single job, the entire job will run with the same calibration. A calibration job cannot run simultaneously while an external job is running.

## How long do calibration jobs run for?

As calibrations are performed on an as-needed basis, the timing of each calibration depends on device performance and scheduling relative to active job flow. For Heron devices, the total calibration time accumulated over the course of a day is not expected to exceed two hours.


## Simultaneously-submitted jobs with different calibrations

**Is it possible for two jobs that were submitted simultaneously to run under different calibrations?**

Yes, it is possible. In this scenario, the first job would run and a calibration job would be interleaved between the end of the first job and the start of the second job. The second job would run under these new calibrations.

## Benchmarking

**Do you run benchmarking for each single qubit, or are qubits benchmarked in parallel?**

All single-qubit calibrations and benchmarking are done in batches of non-nearest-neighbor qubits for efficiency.
