    "The AI-powered transpiler passes are passes that work as a drop-in replacement of \"traditional\" Qiskit passes for some transpiling tasks. They often produce better results than existing heuristic algorithms (such as lower depth and CNOT count), but are also much faster than optimization algorithms such as Boolean satisfiability solvers. The AI transpiler passes can run on your local environment or on the cloud using the Qiskit Transpiler Service if you are part of the IBM Quantum&reg; Premium Plan.\n",

    "- `improve`: This uses the layout set by the previous transpiler passes as a starting point. It is useful when you have a good initial guess for the layout; for example, for circuits that are built in a way that approximately follows the device's coupling map. It is also useful if you want to try other specific layout passes combined with the `AIRouting` pass.\n",
