# Qiskit Code Assistant

Qiskit Code Assistant aims to make quantum computing more accessible to new Qiskit adopters and to improve the coding experience for current users. It is a generative AI code assistant powered by [watsonx](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai). It is trained using millions of text tokens from Qiskit SDK v1.x, years of Qiskit code examples and IBM Quantum&reg; features. Qiskit Code Assistant can help your quantum development workflow by offering LLM-generated suggestions based on [IBM Granite models,](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models) which incorporate the latest features and functionalities from IBM&reg;.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
    - This is an experimental feature available only to IBM Quantum Premium Plan users registered in the [IBM Quantum Platform Classic](https://quantum.ibm.com/).
    - Qiskit Code Assistant is in preview release status and is subject to change.
    - If you have feedback or want to contact the developer team, use the [Qiskit Slack Workspace channel](https://qiskit.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07LYA6PL83) or the related public GitHub repositories.

## Features

The following features are included in the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) and [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extensions:

* Accelerates Qiskit code generation by leveraging generative AI based on Granite models specialized in generating Qiskit code.
* Allows abstract and specific prompts to generate recommendations.
* Presents suggestions that you can review, accept, or reject.
* Supports Python code and Jupyter notebook files.
* Includes guardrails to avoid answering questions that represent a potential risk for users, such as hateful speech.

For instructions to integrate Qiskit Code Assistant directly into your development environment, follow the instructions in the appropriate topic:

- [VS Code](/docs/guides/qiskit-code-assistant-vscode)

## The Large Language Model (LLM) behind Qiskit Code Assistant

To provide code suggestions, Qiskit Code Assistant uses a Large Language Model (LLM). In this case, Qiskit Code Assistant currently relies on the model `granite-3.3-8b-qiskit`, built on the IBM [granite-3.3-8b models.](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-granite/granite-33-language-models-67f65d0cca24bcbd1d3a08e3) The `granite-3.3-8b-qiskit` model improves the `granite-3.3-8b` models' code generation capabilities for Qiskit through extended pretraining and fine-tuning it on high-quality Qiskit data, as well as Python commits and chat. For more information about the IBM Granite models family, refer to [Granite Code Models: A Family of Open Foundation Models for Code Intelligence.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04324) For more details about the `granite-.*-qiskit` models, see [Qiskit Code Assistant: Training LLMs for generating Quantum Computing Code.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19495)

Our LLMs specialized for Qiskit are available also as open-source models. Check all the models available at https://huggingface.co/Qiskit.

## The Qiskit HumanEval benchmark

To test the `granite-.*-qiskit` models, we are creating, in collaboration with Qiskit Advocates and experts, a new execution-based benchmark called Qiskit HumanEval (QHE). This benchmark is similar to [HumanEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374), including multiple challenging code problems to solve, all based on the official Qiskit libraries.

The benchmark is composed of approximately 150 tests, each one made from a function definition, followed by a docstring that details the task the model is required to solve. Each example also includes a reference canonical solution, as well as unit tests, to evaluate the correctness of the generated solutions. There are three levels of difficulty for tests: basic, intermediate, and difficult.


The dataset for the Qiskit HumanEval is expected to be open source soon.
