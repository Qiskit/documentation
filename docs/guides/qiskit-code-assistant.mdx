# Qiskit Code Assistant

Qiskit Code Assistant aims to make quantum computing more accessible to new Qiskit adopters and to improve the coding experience for current users. It is a generative AI code assistant powered by [watsonx](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai). It is trained using millions of text tokens from Qiskit SDK, years of Qiskit code examples and IBM Quantum&reg; features. Qiskit Code Assistant can help your quantum development workflow by offering LLM-generated suggestions based on [IBM Granite models,](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/foundation-models) which incorporate the latest features and functionalities from IBM&reg;.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
    - This is an experimental feature available to IBM Quantum Premium Plan users registered on the new [IBM Quantum Platform.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/)
    - Qiskit Code Assistant is in preview release status and is subject to change.
    - If you have feedback or want to contact the developer team, use the [Qiskit Slack Workspace channel](https://qiskit.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C07LYA6PL83) or the related public GitHub repositories.

Qiskit Code Assistant gives a code suggestion to get the available backends. The user executes the code, gets the available backends in IBM Quantum Platform for the current account. The user asks Qiskit Code Assistant to generate the code to get the T1, T2 and other properties for the qubit 1 in the device ibm_brisbane. The assistant gives a code suggestion. The user runs the suggested code and gets the desired output."/>

## Features

The following features are included in the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) and [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) extensions:

* Accelerates Qiskit code generation by leveraging generative AI based on models specialized in generating Qiskit code.
* Allows abstract and specific prompts to generate recommendations.
* Presents suggestions that you can review, accept, or reject.
* Supports Python code and Jupyter notebook files.
* Includes guardrails to avoid answering questions that represent a potential risk for users, such as hateful speech.

For instructions to integrate Qiskit Code Assistant directly into your development environment, follow the instructions in the appropriate topic:
- [JupyterLab](/docs/guides/qiskit-code-assistant-jupyterlab)
- [VS Code](/docs/guides/qiskit-code-assistant-vscode)

## The Large Language Model (LLM) behind Qiskit Code Assistant

To provide code suggestions, Qiskit Code Assistant uses a Large Language Model (LLM). In this case, Qiskit Code Assistant currently relies on the model `mistral-small-3.2-24b-qiskit`, built on the [Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Qiskit model.](https://huggingface.co/Qiskit/mistral-small-3.2-24b-qiskit) The `mistral-small-3.2-24b-qiskit` model improves the `Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506` model's code generation capabilities for Qiskit through extended pretraining and fine-tuning it on high-quality Qiskit data, as well as Python commits and chat. For more information about the Mistral AI models family, refer to [Mistral AI documentation.](https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models) For more details about the `.*-qiskit` models, see [Qiskit Code Assistant: Training LLMs for generating Quantum Computing Code.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19495)

Our LLMs specialized for Qiskit are available also as open-source models. Check all the models available at https://huggingface.co/Qiskit.

## The Qiskit HumanEval and Qiskit HumanEval Hard benchmarks

To test the `mistral-small-3.2-24b-qiskit` and other models, we collaborated with Qiskit Advocates and experts to create the execution-based benchmark called Qiskit HumanEval (QHE), and ran it on the model. This benchmark is similar to [HumanEval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374), including multiple challenging code problems to solve, all based on the official Qiskit libraries.

The benchmark is composed of approximately 150 tests, each one made from a function definition, followed by a docstring that details the task the model is required to solve. Each example also includes a reference canonical solution, as well as unit tests, to evaluate the correctness of the generated solutions. There are three levels of difficulty for tests: basic, intermediate, and difficult. The Qiskit HumanEval Hard benchmark is a variation of the Qiskit HumanEval one, but removing information related to imports, so the LLM needs to figure out the right imports. That simple change makes the dataset to be much more challenging, according to our tests and initial results.


The datasets for Qiskit HumanEval and Qiskit HumanEval Hard are available at [qiskit_humaneval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Qiskit/qiskit_humaneval) and [qiskit_humaneval_hard](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Qiskit/qiskit_humaneval_hard). You can contribute to the development of these benchmarks in [GitHub.](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-human-eval)
