# Use IBM Cloud Platform APIs to access instances


This guide is for anyone using the IBM Cloud Platform APIs to provision, update, or manage access to instances. It provides details on the [parameters](#parameters) you can set when provisioning an instance, as well as the set of [extension fields](#extensions) returned when you access an instance.

<Admonition type="note">
Refer to the IBM Cloud&reg; ResourceController API documentation for more information.

Some relevant pages:
- [Create (provision) a new resource instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controller#create-resource-instance)
- [Update a resource instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controller#update-resource-instance)
- [Get a resource instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controller#get-resource-instance)
- [Get a list of all resource instances](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controller#list-resource-instances)  
    
    When getting a list of all resource instances, note that you can filter to only Qiskit Runtime instances with `resource_id = "b6049020-80f4-11eb-a0f7-e35ec9b4054f"`

## `parameters`

In the body when provisioning or updating an instance:


- **instance_limit_seconds** (string or null, `^[0-9]+$`): The limit to set on the instance. For Open Plan: if omitted, this defaults to 10 minutes.
.
- **usage_allocation_seconds** (string or null, `^[0-9]+$`): Allotted time for the instance, used by the fair-share scheduler to determine the priority in the queue, based on usage of all QPUs. (This does not apply to Pay-As-You-Go instances.)
- **backends** (array of lists of backends (strings or null) or array with "ANY"): the allow-list of names of backends that are available to this instance. Default: `["ANY"]`, means all backends available on this plan. `[]` means no backends.

## `extensions`

In the response when provisioning or when getting the details of an instance:

Additional instance properties contributed by the service that are represented as key-value pairs. These properties persist with the instance under the extensions property.

- **instance_limit_seconds** (integer or null, `>= 0`): The time limit to set on the instance.
- **usage_allocation_seconds** (integer or null, `>= 0`): Allotted time for the instance, used by the fair-share scheduler to determine the priority in the queue, based on usage of all QPUs.
- **backends** (Required; array of lists of backends (strings) or array with "ANY" (strings)): The allow-list of names of backends that are available to this instance. Default: `["ANY"]`, means all backends are available on this plan. `[]` means no backends.
