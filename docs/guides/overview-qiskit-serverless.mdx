# Qiskit Serverless overview

Creating utility-scale quantum applications generally requires a variety of compute resource requirements. Qiskit Serverless (`qiskit-ibm-catalog.QiskitServerless`) provides a simple interface to run workloads across quantum-classical resources. This includes deploying programs to IBM Quantum Platform and running workloads remotely, as well as easy resource management for multi-cloud and quantum-centric supercomputing use cases. See more information in the [Qiskit Serverless documentation](/docs/guides/serverless) about how to use this collection of tools to:

- Parallelize classical tasks, such as pre-processing and post-processing
- Persist long-running workloads in the cloud, even if your laptop is turned off
- Deploy reusable programs in the cloud

To start using Qiskit Serverless right away, install it with pip:
```bash
pip install qiskit_serverless
```
