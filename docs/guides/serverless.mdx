# What is Qiskit Serverless?

Qiskit Serverless provides a simple interface to run workloads across quantum-classical resources. This includes deploying programs to the IBM Quantum&trade; Platform and running workloads remotely, as well as easy resource management for multi-cloud and quantum-centric supercomputing use cases.

Premium users can build, deploy, and run their workloads remotely on classical compute made available through IBM Quantum Platform. Try out the tutorials in [IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/catalog/tutorials?topics=qiskit-patterns) (note: these are accessible in the Premium Plan once you have logged into your IBM Quantum account).

## When should I use Qiskit Serverless?

Qiskit Serverless helps manage classical and quantum resources across the entire [Qiskit pattern](./intro-to-patterns) workflow. This includes some of the following examples:

- Parallelizing classical tasks, such as pre-processing and post-processing
- Persisting long-running workloads in the cloud, even if your laptop is turned off
- Deploying reusable programs

## Install Qiskit Serverless

To use Qiskit Serverless on IBM Quantum Platform, install the following packages:

```bash
pip install qiskit-ibm-catalog qiskit_serverless
```

`qiskit_ibm_catalog` provides the client-side tools to upload and run remote programs, while `qiskit_serverless` provides server-side tools to distribute compute and manage data. These packages require `python` 3.11+. For users and organizations who want to run Qiskit Serverless on custom infrastructure, follow the [Cloud infrastructure setup](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-serverless/) guide.

Currently, the IBM Quantum workloads table only reflects Qiskit Runtime workloads. Use `job.status()` to see your Qiskit Serverless workload's current status.
