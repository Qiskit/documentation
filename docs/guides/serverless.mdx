# What is Qiskit Serverless?

Qiskit Serverless provides a simple interface to run workloads across quantum-classical resources. This includes deploying programs to the IBM Quantum&trade; Platform, running workloads remotely, and easy resource management for multi-cloud and quantum-centric supercomputing use cases.

Premium users can build, deploy, and run their workloads remotely on classical compute made available through the IBM Quantum Platform. Try out the tutorials in [IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/catalog/tutorials?topics=qiskit-patterns) (note: these are accessible in the Premium Plan once you have logged into your IBM Quantum account).

## When should I use Qiskit Serverless?

Qiskit Serverless helps manage classical and quantum resources across the entire Qiskit pattern workflow. This includes some of the following examples:

- Parallelizing classical tasks, such as pre-processing and post-processing
- Persisting long running workloads in the cloud, even if your laptop is turned off
- Deploying reusable programs

## Install Qiskit Serverless

To use Qiskit Serverless on IBM Quantum Platform, install the `qiskit-serverless` package:

```bash
pip install qiskit-serverless
```

This package requires `python` 3.11+. For users and organizations who want to run Serverless on custom infrastructure, follow the [deploy Qiskit Serverless on custom cloud resources guide](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-serverless/cloud.html).
