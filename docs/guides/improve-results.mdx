# Tools to manage noise

## Dynamical decoupling
[Dynamical decoupling](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#dynamical-decoupling) inserts pulse sequences on idling qubits to try to mitigate coherence errors caused by unwanted interactions between qubits during circuit execution. Enable this technique in the Qiskit Runtime option [`DynamicalDecouplingOptions`.](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-dynamical-decoupling-options)

## Pauli twirling
[Pauli twirling](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#pauli-twirling) is a special kind of twirling that uses Pauli operations. It transforms any quantum channel into a Pauli channel. It can mitigate coherent noise by itself but is often combined with other error mitigation techniques that work better with Pauli noise than with arbitrary noise. Enable this technique in the Qiskit Runtime options by setting `enable_gates` to `True` in the [twirling options.](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-twirling-options)

## Twirled readout error extinction
[Twirled readout error extinction (TREX)](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#pauli-twirling#twirled-readout-error-extinction-trex) mitigates the effect of measurement errors for the estimation of Pauli observable expectation values. Enable TREX by setting `measure_mitigation` to `True` in the Qiskit Runtime [resilience options](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-resilience-options-v2) for Estimator.

## Zero-noise extrapolation
[Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE)](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#pauli-twirling#zero-noise-extrapolation-zne) is used for mitigating errors when estimating observables' expectation values. It consists of two phases: noise amplification and extrapolation.  To enable ZNE, set  `zne_mitigation` to `True` in the Qiskit Runtime [resilience options](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-resilience-options-v2) for Estimator.

## Propagated noise absorption
The [Propagated noise absorption (PNA)](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-pna/) addon implements the PNA technique.  This is a technique for mitigating errors in observable expectation values by “absorbing” the inverses of the learned noise channels into the observable using [Pauli propagation.](https://qiskit.github.io/pauli-prop/) Each Pauli noise generator in the noise model is classically propagated to the end of the circuit and applied to the observable, resulting in a new observable that when measured on a QPU, mitigates the learned gate noise.

## Probabilistic error amplification
[Probabilistic error amplification (PEA)](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#probabilistic-error-amplification-pea) is a  sophisticated ZNE technique that consists of three stages: learning, noise amplification, and extrapolation. To enable PEA, enable ZNE by setting  `zne_mitigation` to `True` and set `zne.amplifier` to `pea` in the Qiskit Runtime [resilience options](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-resilience-options-v2) for Estimator.

## Probabilistic error cancellation
[Probabilistic error cancellation (PEC)](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#probabilistic-error-cancellation-pec) is a technique for mitigating errors in estimating expectation values of observables. Unlike ZNE, it returns an unbiased estimate of the expectation value. However, it generally incurs a greater overhead. To eanble PEC, set `pec_mitigation` to `True` in the Qiskit Runtime [resilience options](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-resilience-options-v2) for Estimator.

## Shaded lightcones
The [Shaded lightcones (SLC)](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-slc/) addon can be used to reduce the sampling overhead of PEC.

## Directed execution model (beta)
The [directed execution model](/docs/guides/directed-execution-model), currently in beta release, provides the ingredients to capture design intents on the client side, and shifts the costly generation of circuit variants to the server side, so that you can fine-tune error mitigation and other techniques without sacrificing performance.

## Operator backpropagation
The [Operator backpropagation (OBP)](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-obp) addon uses a method based on Clifford perturbation theory to reduce circuit depth by trimming operations from its end at the cost of more operator measurements. [Get started with OBP.](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-obp-get-started)

## AQC-Tensor
The [AQC-Tensor](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-aqc) addon enables users to compile the initial portion of a circuit into a nearly equivalent approximation of that circuit, but with much fewer layers. [Get started with AQC-Tensor.](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-aqc-get-started)

## Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization
The [Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD)](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd) addon implements a technique for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of quantum operators, such as a quantum system Hamiltonian, using quantum and distributed classical computing together.

## SQD (HPC-ready)
The [SQD (HPC-ready)](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-sqd-hpc/) addon is an HPC-ready implementation of the [Qiskit addon for SQD.](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd) [Get started with SQD.](https://qiskit.github.io/documentation/pr-4251/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-sqd-get-started)

## mthree
The [mthree (M3)](https://qiskit.github.io/qiskit-addon-mthree/) addon is a package for scalable quantum measurement error mitigation that need not explicitly form the assignment matrix, or its inverse, as is thus a matrix-free measurement mitigation routine.
