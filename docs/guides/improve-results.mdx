# Tools to improve result quality

- [Dynamical decoupling](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#dynamical-decoupling) - Dynamical decoupling inserts pulse sequences on idling qubits to try to mitigate coherence errors caused by unwanted interactions between qubits during circuit execution. Enable this technique in the Qiskit Runtime option [`DynamicalDecouplingOptions`.](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-dynamical-decoupling-options)
- [Pauli twirling](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#pauli-twirling) - Pauli twirling is a special kind of twirling that uses Pauli operations. It transforms any quantum channel into a Pauli channel. It can mitigate coherent noise by itself but is often combined with other error mitigation techniques that work better with Pauli noise than with arbitrary noise. Enable this technique in the Qiskit Runtime options by setting `enable_gates` to `True` in the [twirling options.](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-twirling-options)
- [Twirled readout error extinction (TREX)](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#pauli-twirling#twirled-readout-error-extinction-trex) - TREX mitigates the effect of measurement errors for the estimation of Pauli observable expectation values. Enable TREX by setting `measure_mitigation` to `True` in the Qiskit Runtime [resilience options](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-resilience-options-v2) for Estimator.
- [Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE)](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#pauli-twirling#zero-noise-extrapolation-zne) - ZNE is used for mitigating errors when estimating observables' expectation values. It consists of two phases: noise amplification and extrapolation.  To enable ZNE, set  `zne_mitigation` to `True` in the Qiskit Runtime [resilience options](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-resilience-options-v2) for Estimator.
- [Probabilistic Error Amplification (PEA)](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#probabilistic-error-amplification-pea) - PEA is a  sophisticated ZNE technique that consists of three stages: learning, noise amplification, and extrapolation. To enable PEA, enable ZNE by setting  `zne_mitigation` to `True` and set `zne.amplifier` to `pea` in the Qiskit Runtime [resilience options](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-resilience-options-v2) for Estimator.
- [Probabilistic error cancellation (PEC)](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#probabilistic-error-cancellation-pec) - PEC is a technique for mitigating errors in estimating expectation values of observables. Unlike ZNE, it returns an unbiased estimate of the expectation value. However, it generally incurs a greater overhead. To eanble PEC, set `pec_mitigation` to `True` in the Qiskit Runtime [resilience options](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-resilience-options-v2) for Estimator.
- [Operator backpropagation (OBP)](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-obp) - This addon uses a method based on Clifford perturbation theory to reduce circuit depth by trimming operations from its end at the cost of more operator measurements. [Get started with OBP.](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-obp-get-started)
- [AQC-Tensor](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-aqc) - This addon enables users to compile the initial portion of a circuit into a nearly equivalent approximation of that circuit, but with much fewer layers. [Get started with AQC-Tensor.](/docs/guides/qiskit-addons-aqc-get-started)
