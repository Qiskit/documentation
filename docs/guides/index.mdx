# Introduction

## Introduction to Qiskit and IBM Quantum

Welcome to the documentation for Qiskit, its related packages, and IBM Quantum&reg; Platform. This documentation includes how-to guides to get you started on our tools, specific use-case tutorials that include end-to-end examples, and a collection of API references.

Qiskit provides a modular and extensible framework for quantum research and development across algorithms, high-performance computing, and quantum information science. With it, researchers can build, optimize, and execute quantum workflows with specialized addons, software tools, and extensive resources. Through IBM Quantum Platform, users can access Quantum Compute services, such as Qiskit Runtime and the Qiskit Functions Catalog, to run workloads efficiently on the IBM&reg; fleet of quantum computers.

Beyond Qiskit and its related packages is the [Qiskit ecosystem](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/ecosystem), a catalog of open-source projects that interface with Qiskit to extend its functionality.
