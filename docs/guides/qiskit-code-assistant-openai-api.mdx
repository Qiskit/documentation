# Qiskit Code Assistant - OpenAI API compatibility

Qiskit Code Assistant offers compatibility with a subset of the OpenAI API specification, specifically with the [completions API endpoints](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions). The goal of this compatibility is to allow third-party packages to connect to Qiskit Code Assistant seamlessly by using well-known AI-related libraries and methods such as [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm), or others.

## OpenAI API endpoints supported

| Method | Path | Comment |
|--|--|---|
| **GET** | `/v1/models` | List all models |
| **GET** | `/v1/model/{model}` | Get model detail |
| **POST** | `/v1/completions` | Send prompt to model for completion |

<Admonition type="note">
The `/v1/completions` endpoint fails with a `403` error if the model disclaimer has been accepted. See the following for how to view and accept the model disclaimer.
</Admonition>

Additional endpoints (not part of OpenAI schema, provided for convenience) include:

| Method | Path | Comment |
|--|--|---|
| **GET** | `/v1/model/{model}/disclaimer` | Get model's disclaimer |
| **POST** | `/v1/model/{model}/disclaimer` | Accept model's disclaimer |
| **POST** | `/v1/completions/accept` | Accept or reject completion |

To retrieve/view the model disclaimer, make a **GET** request to the disclaimer endpoint. For example:

```
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://qiskit-code-assistant.quantum.ibm.com/v1/model/granite-3.3-8b-qiskit/disclaimer' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <IBM Quantum Classic API key>'
```

If you agree with the model disclaimer, to accept it, **POST** to the disclaimer endpoint providing the disclaimer's ID and whether it is accepted or rejected. For example:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://qiskit-code-assistant.quantum.ibm.com/v1/model/granite-3.3-8b-qiskit/disclaimer' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <IBM Quantum Classic API key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "disclaimer": "<DISCLAIMER_ID>",
  "accepted": true
}'
```


## Examples

### Use the official OpenAI Python library

The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API (such as the one provided by Qiskit Code Assistant) from any Python 3.8+ application. See more details in the [Installation section](https://github.com/openai/openai-python?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) of the OpenAI Python API library Readme.


```
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize the client with your API token
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="<IBM Quantum Classic API token>",
    base_url="https://qiskit-code-assistant.quantum.ibm.com/v1",
)

# Make a request to the completions API
try:
    response = client.completions.create(
        model="granite-3.3-8b-qiskit",
        prompt="#Transpile a random circuit using the Qiskit Transpiler Service",
    )

    # Print the generated text
    print(response.choices[0].text)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```

### Use LiteLLM

LiteLLM is a convenient Python library to access multiple LLM APIs using the OpenAI format (Bedrock, Huggingface, VertexAI, TogetherAI, Azure, OpenAI, Groq, and so on). See the [LiteLLM docs](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm?tab=readme-ov-file#usage-docs) for more details.

```
from litellm import completion

response = completion(
    model=f"text-completion-openai/granite-3.3-8b-qiskit",
    base_url="https://qiskit-code-assistant.quantum.ibm.com/v1",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "#Transpile a random circuit using the Qiskit Transpiler Service",
        }
    ],
    api_key="<IBM Quantum Classic API key>",
)

completion_response = response.json()
print(completion_response)
```
