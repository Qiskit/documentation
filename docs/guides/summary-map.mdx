# Introduction to mapping tools

Mapping tools assist with mapping a classical problem to circuits and operators, for execution on a quantum computer.

In applications such as chemistry and quantum simulation, mapping generally involves constructing a quantum circuit representing the Hamiltonian you are attempting to solve. For certain problems, it might also be desirable to specify the mapping ofthe problem onto qubits in the heavy-hex (or gross) lattice of IBM&reg; hardware from the outset if the structure of the problem lends itself to optimization earlier.

It is also worth considering at this point what the outcome of the particular algorithm will be in preparation for the later execute step - for example, if the desired outcome involves
inferring correlation functions using Hadamard tests, you might prepare to use Sampler; if it involves specifying observables, you would use Estimator.

The output map is normally a collection of circuits or quantum operators.
