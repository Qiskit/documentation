    "# Tensor-network error mitigation (TEM): A Qiskit Function by Algorithmiq\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tensor-network error mitigation (TEM) function computes expectation values of quantum circuits and observables by post-processing noise-induced errors in estimations of physical observables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method consists of constructing a tensor network representing the inverse of the global noise channel affecting the state of the quantum processor, and then applying the map to informationally complete measurement outcomes obtained from the noisy state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an advantage, TEM leverages informationally complete measurements to give access to a vast set of mitigated expectation values of observables and has optimal sampling\n",
    "overhead on the quantum hardware [1]. TEM can also be advantageous with respect to purely classical tensor network methods, giving accurate results with a smaller computational cost than a classical-only tensor network approach.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Function description\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The TEM function takes a noisy circuit with the noisy layers identified. The circuit is measured with an informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (IC-POVM), and the collected measurement outcomes are processed on a classical computer. This measurement is used to perform the tensor network methods and build a noise-inversion map $\\mathcal{N}^{-1}$. The function applies a map $\\mathcal{M}$ that fully inverts the whole noisy circuit using matrix product operators to represent the noisy layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![TEM schematics](/images/guides/algorithmiq-tem/tem_scheme.svg \"Error-mitigated estimation of an observable O via post-processing measurement outcomes of the noisy quantum processor. U and N denote an ideal quantum operation and the associated noise map, which can be generally non-local (and extended to grey boxes). D stands for a tensor of operators that are dual to the effects in the IC measurement. The noise mitigation module M is a tensor network that is efficiently contracted from the middle out. The first iteration of the contraction is represented by the dotted purple line, the second one by the dashed line, and the third one by the solid line.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the noise, the algorithm performs a contraction that starts from the middle (where the inverted noisy circuit ends and the ideal circuit starts) and propagates outward by involving two layers on the left side and one layer on the right side at each iteration. Therefore, the noisy circuit output state $\\rho$ is reverted back to $(\\vert 0 \\rangle\\langle0\\vert)^{\\otimes N}$, which in turn is mapped to the ideal noiseless state operator $\\vert\\psi\\rangle\\langle \\psi\\vert$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise-mitigated estimation of an observable ${O}$ is then read as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{O}_{\\text{n}.\\text{m}} = \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\text{tr} [\\mathcal{M}(D_{\\mathbf{k}})O] = \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\text{tr} [D_{\\mathbf{k}}\\mathcal{M}^{\\dagger}(O)],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $D\\mathbf{k}$ is the dual operator of the corresponding POVM associated with a measurement shot $\\mathbf{k}$ in a set of $S$ shots.\n",
