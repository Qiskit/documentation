# Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD)

Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is a technique for finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of quantum operators, such as the Hamiltonian of a quantum system, using quantum and distributed classical computing together.

Classical computing is used to process samples obtained from a quantum processor, and to project and diagonalize a target Hamiltonian in a subspace spanned by them. This allows SQD to be robust to samples corrupted by quantum noise and manage large Hamiltonians, such as chemical systems with millions of interacting terms, beyond the reach of exact diagonalization methods.

The SQD tool can target Hamiltonians expressed as linear combinations of Pauli operators, or second-quantized fermionic operators. The input samples are obtained by quantum circuits defined by the user, which are believed to be good representations of eigenstates (for example the ground state) of a target operator. The convergence rate of SQD as a function of the number of samples improves with the sparseness of the target eigenstate.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the SQD package. Via PyPI and building from source. We also recommend installing these packages in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) to ensure separation between package dependencies.

### Install from PyPI

The most straightforward way to install the `qiskit-addon-sqd` package is via PyPI.

```bash
pip install qiskit-addon-sqd
```

### Build from source

Users who wish to contribute to this package or who want to install it manually may do so by first cloning the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Qiskit/qiskit-addon-sqd.git
```

and install the package via `pip`. The repository also contains example notebooks which can be run and if you plan on developing in the repository, you may want to also install the `dev` dependencies.

Adjust the options to suit your needs.

```bash
pip install tox notebook -e '.[notebook-dependencies, dev]'
```

## SQD procedure

The SQD workflow using self-consistent configuration recovery is explained in detail in [[1]](#references). This page will briefly overview the technique depicted in the following diagram.

Here $\bar{\mathcal{X}}$ is a set of noisy samples containing, in the context of the Hamiltonian being simulated, physical and non-physical configurations (represented as bitstrings) obtained from execution on a QPU. The non-physical configurations are due to noise and can be processed by the `sqd.configuration_recovery.recover_configurations()` method to refine the samples into a new set $\mathcal{X}_R$. 

From this set, batches of configurations $\mathcal{S}^{(1)}...\ \mathcal{S}^{(K)}$ are collected and represent samples obtained from different subspaces of the Hamiltonian. These subspace samples are built from a set of basis states, $\mathcal{S}^{(k)}=\{|\mathbf{x}^{(k)}\rangle\}$, and are projections of the system Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}$. This projection is defined as

$$ \hat{H}_{S^{(k)}} = \hat{P}_{\mathcal{S}^{(k)}}\hat{H}\hat{P}_{\mathcal{S}^{(k)}}\text{, with } \hat{P}_{\mathcal{S}^{(k)}} = \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{S}^{(k)}} |\mathbf{x}\rangle\langle\mathbf{x}|$$

where $\hat{H}_{\mathcal{S}^{(k)}}$ is the Hamiltonian of a given subspace.

The bulk of the SQD workflow lies here where each of these subspace Hamiltonians are diagonalized. The ground states obtained from each of these subspaces, $|\psi^{(k)}\rangle$, and are used to obtain an estimate of a reference vector of occupancies $\mathbf{n}^{(K)}$ averaged over each of the $K$ subspaces and sent back to the configuration recovery step. Then a new set of subspaces are obtained and diagonalized, and this procedure iterates in a self-consistent loop until the ground state energy estimate has converged.
