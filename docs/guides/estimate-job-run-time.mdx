Usage is a measurement of the amount of time the QPU is locked for your workload, and it is calculated differently, depending on which execution mode you're using.

* Session usage is the time from when the first job starts until the session goes inactive, is closed, or when its last job completes, whichever happens last. It includes both classical and quantum time (time spent by the QPU complex to process your job).
* Batch usage is the sum of quantum time of all jobs in the batch.
* Single job usage is the quantum time the job uses in processing.

The usage reported on the dashboard or by using the API is the time a QPU is locked for your workload. Failed or canceled jobs count toward your usage in certain circumstances - see the [Failed and canceled jobs](#failed-job) section for details.

For Standard Plan users, usage determines how much the workload costs. See [Manage cost](/guides/manage-cost) for details.

Your usage has different impacts, depending on which channel you're using:

- For Qiskit Runtime on IBM Cloud&reg; users, the usage determines how much the job costs.  See [Manage cost](/guides/manage-cost) for details.
- For IBM Quantum&reg; Platform users, this translates to shares. The [fair-share scheduler](/guides/fair-share-scheduler) prioritizes instances with the most shares left. Thus, the higher your usage, the longer your next job stays in the queue.

## Usage for failed and canceled jobs

When a job is failed or canceled, the reported usage is as follows:

* Job or batch mode: The reported usage is the time the QPU was locked for executing your workload until the time it failed or was canceled. Therefore, if the failure or cancellation occurred before the lock, the reported usage is zero. Otherwise, the workload's reported usage is the amount of usage before the workload failed or was canceled. Thus, some failed jobs do not appear in your reported usage and others do.

* Session mode: The reported usage is the wall-clock time from when the first job started executing in the session until the session terminates, regardless of the number of jobs that fail or are canceled.

## Determine a workload's actual usage

After a workload has completed, there are several ways to view its actual usage:

- On the IBM Quantum Platform [Workloads table](https://quantum.ibm.com/workloads) in the Usage column.  From the Home page, click *View all* on the Recent workloads table.  The Usage column shows actual usage for completed workloads.
- Run [`batch.usage()`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/batch#usage) or [`session.usage()`](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/session#usage) in `qiskit-ibm-runtime` 0.30 or later.  If using an older version of `qiskit-ibm-runtime` (>= 0.23 and < 0.30), the usage can be still be found in `session.details()["usage_time"]` and `batch.details()["usage_time"]`.
- Call the [GET usage](/api/runtime/tags/usage#tags__usage) REST API directly to see the total usage across all workloads for your account (IBM Quantum Platform channel only).
- Use [`GET /sessions/{id}`](/api/runtime/tags/sessions#tags__sessions__operations__GetSessionDetailsExtendedController_getSessionDetails) to see usage for a specific batch or session.
- Use [`GET /jobs/{id}`](/api/runtime/tags/jobs#tags__jobs__operations__GetJobByIdController_getJobById) to see usage for a single job.

## Estimate workload usage

After submitting a job to the IBM Quantum channel, you can see an estimation for how much _quantum time_ the job will take to run by using `job.usage_estimation`.  Alternatively, you can [view this information on the IBM Quantum Platform user interface](#view-usage).

Quantum time is the duration, in seconds, a QPU is committed to fulfilling a user request.

Example:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, SamplerV2 as Sampler
from qiskit.transpiler import generate_preset_pass_manager

service = QiskitRuntimeService()

# Create a new circuit with two qubits (first argument) and two classical
# bits (second argument)
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Add a Hadamard gate to qubit 0
qc.h(0)

# Perform a controlled-X gate on qubit 1, controlled by qubit 0
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure qubit 0 to cbit 0, and qubit 1 to cbit 1
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.measure(1, 1)

# Run on the least-busy device you have access to
backend = service.least_busy(simulator=False,operational=True)

# Generate ISA circuits
pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)
isa_circuit = pm.run(qc)

# Create a Sampler object
sampler = Sampler(backend)

# Submit the circuit to the sampler
job = sampler.run([isa_circuit])

print(job.usage_estimation)
```
Output:

```python
{'quantum_seconds': 4.1058720028432445}
```
