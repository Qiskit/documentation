# Estimate job run time

After submitting a job to the IBM Quantum&trade; channel, you can see an estimation for how much _quantum time_ the job will take to run by using `job.usage_estimation`.  Alternatively, you can [view this information on the IBM Quantum Platform user interface](#view-usage).

Quantum time is the duration, in seconds, a QPU is committed to fulfilling a user request.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
    - This only applies to jobs that use primitives.
    - This is not yet available on the Qiskit Runtime on IBM Cloud&reg; channel.

Example:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, SamplerV2 as Sampler
from qiskit.transpiler.preset_passmanagers import generate_preset_pass_manager

service = QiskitRuntimeService()

# Create a new circuit with two qubits (first argument) and two classical
# bits (second argument)
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Add a Hadamard gate to qubit 0
qc.h(0)

# Perform a controlled-X gate on qubit 1, controlled by qubit 0
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure qubit 0 to cbit 0, and qubit 1 to cbit 1
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.measure(1, 1)

# Run on the least-busy device you have access to
backend = service.least_busy(simulator=False,operational=True)

# Generate ISA circuits
pm = generate_preset_pass_manager(backend=backend, optimization_level=1)
isa_circuit = pm.run(qc)

# Create a Sampler object
sampler = Sampler(backend)

# Submit the circuit to the sampler
job = sampler.run([isa_circuit])

print(job.usage_estimation)
```
Output:

```python
{'quantum_seconds': 4.1058720028432445}
```

## View the estimated workload (job) usage on IBM Quantum Platform

You can view the estimated usage (how much quantum time the workload will take to run) in two places on IBM Quantum Platform:

- On the [Workloads table](https://quantum.ibm.com/workloads) in the Usage column.  From the Home page, click *View all* on the Recent workloads table.  The Usage column shows the estimated usage for pending workloads, or actual usage for completed workloads.
- On the workload's details page. From the [Dashboard](https://quantum.ibm.com/) or [Workloads table](https://quantum.ibm.com/workloads), click the ID to open its details page.  The estimated usage is shown in the Status timeline.
