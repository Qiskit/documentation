    "Dynamic circuits are powerful tools that let us measure qubits in the middle of a quantum circuit execution and then perform classical logical operations within the circuit, based on the outcome of those mid-circuit measurements.  This process is also known as _classical feedforward_. While we are still in the early days of understanding how best to take advantage of dynamic circuits, the quantum research community has already identified a number of use cases, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficient quantum state preparation, such as [W-state](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07969) and [MPS state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16083)\n",
    "* [Efficient long-range entanglement](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.030339) between qubits on the same chip by using shallow circuits\n",
    "* Efficient [sampling of IQP-like circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04705)\n",
    "\n",
    "These improvements brought by dynamic circuits, however, come with trade-offs. Mid-circuit measurements and classical operations typically have longer execution time than two-qubit gates, and this increase in time might negate the benefits of reduced circuit depth. Therefore, reducing the length of mid-circuit measurement is a focus area of improvement as IBM Quantum rolls out the [new version](/announcements/product-updates/2025-03-03-new-version-dynamic-circuits) of dynamic circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [OpenQASM3 specification](https://openqasm.com/language/classical.html#looping-and-branching) defines a number of conditional instructions, but Qiskit Runtime currently only supports the [if_test](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#if_test) statement, which can be used as a method on [QuantumCircuit.](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) This methods returns a [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers) and is typically used in a `with` statement. This guide describes how to use this conditional statement."
