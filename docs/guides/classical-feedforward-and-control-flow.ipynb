    "Dynamic circuits are powerful tools with which your can measure qubits in the middle of a quantum circuit execution and then perform classical logic operations within the circuit, based on the outcome of those mid-circuit measurements.  This process is also known as _classical feedforward_. While these are early days of understanding how best to take advantage of dynamic circuits, the quantum research community has already identified a number of use cases, such as the following:\n",

    "These improvements brought by dynamic circuits, however, come with trade-offs. Mid-circuit measurements and classical operations typically have longer execution time than two-qubit gates, and this increase in time might negate the benefits of reduced circuit depth. Therefore, reducing the length of mid-circuit measurement is a focus area of improvement as IBM Quantum&reg; releases the [new version](/announcements/product-updates/2025-03-03-new-version-dynamic-circuits) of dynamic circuits.\n",

In Qiskit SDK, this corresponds to the [if_test](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#if_test) method on [QuantumCircuit.](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) This method returns a [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers) and is typically used in a `with` statement.

You apply $X$ to every unmeasured site for which the parity of all preceding bits is odd. Finally, CNOT gates are applied to the measured qubits to re-establish the entanglement lost in the measurement.\n",

    "\n",
    "   When processing an `if` condition, measurement data needs to be transferred to the control logic to make that evaluation. A broadcast is a transfer of unique classical data, and broadcasted bits is the number of classical bits being transferred. Consider the following:\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   In the previous code example, the first two `if_test`s on `c0` are considered one broadcast because the content of `c0` did not change, and thus does not need to be re-broadcasted. The `if_test` on `c1` is a second broadcast. The first one broadcasts all three bits in `c0` and the second broadcasts just one bit, making a total of four broadcasted bits.\n",

    "   Currently, if you broadcast 60 bits each time, then the job can have approximately 300 broadcasts. If you broadcast just one bit each time, however, then the job can have 2400 broadcasts.\n",
    "- Limitations on classical registers:\n",
    "      - The operand used in an `if_test` statement must be 32 or fewer bits. Thus, if you are comparing an entire `ClassicalRegister`, the size of that `ClassicalRegister` must be 32 or fewer bits. If you are comparing just a single bit from a `ClassicalRegister`, however, that `ClassicalRegister` can be of any size (since the operand is only one bit).\n",

Classical operations, for example, are not supported because they cannot be loaded into Qiskit. See [Import an OpenQASM 3 program into Qiskit](/docs/guides/interoperate-qiskit-qasm3#import-an-openqasm-3-program-into-qiskit) for more information on loading an OpenQASM 3 program into Qiskit."
