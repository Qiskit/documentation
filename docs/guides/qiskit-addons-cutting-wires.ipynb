    "This guide demonstrates a working example of wire cuts with the `qiskit-addon-cutting` package. It covers reconstructing expectation values of a seven-qubit circuit using wire cutting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wire cut is represented in this package as a two-qubit [`Move`](/docs/api/qiskit-addon-cutting/instructions-move) instruction, which is defined as a reset of the second qubit the instruction acts on, followed by a swap of both qubits. This operation is equivalent to transferring the state of the first qubit to the second qubit, while simultaneously discarding the incoming state of the second qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package is designed to be consistent with the way you must treat wire cuts when acting on physical qubits. For example, a wire cut might take the state of physical qubit $n$ and continue it as a physical qubit $m$ after the cut. You can think of \"instruction cutting\" as a unified framework for considering both wire and gate cuts within the same formalism (since a wire cut is just a cut [`Move`](/docs/api/qiskit-addon-cutting/instructions-move) instruction). Using this framework for wire cutting also allows for qubit re-use, which is explained in the section on [cutting wires manually](#cut-wires-using-the-low-level-move-instruction).\n",
    "\n",
    "The single-qubit [`CutWire`](/docs/api/qiskit-addon-cutting/instructions-cut-wire) instruction acts as a more abstracted, simpler interface for working with wire cuts. It allows you to denote where in the circuit a wire should be cut at a high level and have the circuit cutting addon insert the appropriate [`Move`](/docs/api/qiskit-addon-cutting/instructions-move) instructions for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates expectation value reconstruction after wire cutting. You will create a circuit with several non-local gates and define observables to estimate."
