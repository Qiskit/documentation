Dynamic circuits are powerful tools that let us measure qubits in the middle of a quantum circuit execution and then perform classical logic operations within the circuit, based on the outcome of those mid-circuit measurements.  This process is also known as _classical feedforward_. While we are still in the early days of understanding how best to take advantage of dynamic circuits, the quantum research community has already identified a number of use cases, such as the following:

* Efficient quantum state preparation, such as [W-state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07969) and [MPS state](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16083)
* [Efficient long-range entanglement](https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.030339) between qubits on the same chip by using shallow circuits
* Efficient [sampling of IQP-like circuits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04705)

These improvements brought by dynamic circuits, however, come with trade-offs. Mid-circuit measurements and classical operations typically have longer execution time than two-qubit gates, and this increase in time might negate the benefits of reduced circuit depth. Therefore, reducing the length of mid-circuit measurement is a focus area of improvement as IBM Quantum rolls out the [new version](/announcements/product-updates/2025-03-03-new-version-dynamic-circuits) of dynamic circuits.

The [OpenQASM 3 specification](https://openqasm.com/language/classical.html#looping-and-branching) defines a number of control-flow structures, but Qiskit Runtime currently only supports the conditional `if` statement. In Qiskit SDK, this corresponds to the [if_test](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#if_test) method on [QuantumCircuit.](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) This method returns a [context manager](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#with-statement-context-managers) and is typically used in a `with` statement. This guide describes how to use this conditional statement.
