# Map problem to quantum circuits and operators

![All Qiskit pattern steps are shown (Map problem, Optimize for hardware, Execute on hardware, and Post-process results). The 'Map problem' step is emphasized.  This step uses the Qiskit SDK.](/images/qiskit-patterns/map-problem.svg)

The "map problem to quantum circuits and operators" step of a Qiskit pattern describes how a user starts with a classical
problem and figures out how to map it to a quantum computer.

For example, in applications such as chemistry and quantum simulation, this step generally involves
constructing a quantum circuit representing the Hamiltonian you are attempting to solve.
During this step, for certain problems, it might also be desirable to specify the mapping of
the problem onto qubits in the heavy-hex (or gross) lattice of IBM&reg; hardware from the
outset if the structure of the problem lends itself to optimization earlier.

It is also worth considering at this point what the outcome of the particular algorithm will be
in preparation for the later execute step - for example, if the desired outcome involves
inferring correlation functions using Hadamard tests, you might prepare to use Sampler, whereas
specifying observables would use Estimator and could provide many error mitigation options.

The output of this step in a Qiskit pattern is normally a collection of circuits or quantum operators.
