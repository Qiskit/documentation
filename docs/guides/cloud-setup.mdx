# Set up your IBM Cloud account

If you have an invitation to join an account, follow the steps in [Set up your IBM Cloud account - invited users](/docs/guides/cloud-setup-invited) instead.

You can run workloads on IBM&reg; quantum processing units (QPUs) by setting up an account on IBM Cloud&reg;. You will also need to [install and set up Qiskit and Qiskit Runtime](/docs/guides/install-qiskit#local).

Your user account is associated with one or more [instances,](./instances) identified by _Cloud Resource Names_ (CRNs) that give access to IBM Quantum services. Additionally, a unique API token (also called a key) is assigned to each account, allowing for IBM Quantum access from Qiskit.  For instructions to choose a specific instance, see [Connect to an instance](./instances#connect-instance).

    <Admonition type="note">
      The [IBM Quantum Platform dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) and the [Instances page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) list the instances that you can access.

## Set up to use IBM Cloud

### Before you begin

1. If you do not already have one, set up an [IBM Cloud account.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/registration)
   <Admonition type="note">
   You can be part of multiple IBM Cloud accounts (although you can only **own** one account).  You can access any of your IBM Cloud accounts at any time from the account switcher in the header of the [IBM Quantum Platform interface](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com).
   </Admonition>
1. Log in to [IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) with an IBMid or Google account.  If you don't have one, you are guided through creating one.
1. Make sure that the correct account and region are selected in the account switcher in the header, as shown in the following image.

    The region controls where your jobs are run and where the job data is kept. You can access either region by using the same API key, but you can only see and access the instances that were created in the region that you're logged in to.

    ![The IBM Quantum Platform header is shown.  The account switcher is to the right of the search bar.  The region switcher is to the right of the account switcher.](/docs/images/guides/cloud-setup/IQP-Header.svg 'IBM Quantum Platform header')


### 1. Create an instance

You can create an instance from the IBM Quantum Platform [Instances](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) page.  See [Create an instance](/docs/guides/instances#add-instance) for detailed instructions.

### 3. Connect Qiskit with your service instance

- **Trusted Python environment** (such as on a personal laptop or workstation):
    1. (Recommended) Use the `save_account()` method to [save your credentials locally.](/docs/guides/save-credentials)
    1. Use your credentials to [initialize the service.](/docs/guides/initialize-account)
- **Untrusted environment** (such as a public computer)
    See [Initialize the service in an untrusted environment](/docs/guides/untrusted) for instructions.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
   * Follow [these instructions](/docs/guides/cloud-setup-rest-api) if you want to connect by using the REST API instead of using Qiskit.
   * If necessary, use [this information](/docs/guides/quickstart-steps-org#firewall) to configure your firewall to enable access to the IBM Quantum API endpoints.
