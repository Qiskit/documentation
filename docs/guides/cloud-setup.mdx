# Set up your IBM Cloud account
<Admonition type="note">
This documentation is relevant to the new IBM Quantum&reg; Platform. If you need the previous version, return to the [IBM Quantum Platform Classic documentation.](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/setup-channel)
</Admonition>
You can run workloads on IBM&reg; quantum processing units (QPUs) by setting up an account on IBM Cloud&reg;. You will also need to [install and set up Qiskit and Qiskit Runtime](/docs/guides/install-qiskit#local).

<Admonition type="caution" title="Important">
The [updated version of IBM Quantum Platform](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) is in **early access** mode.  Therefore, you can log on, create instances, run jobs, and so on, but some functions are not available yet.  If you need to use functions that are not yet available, use [IBM Quantum Platform Classic](https://quantum.ibm.com/) or [Qiskit Runtime on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum) instead.
</Admonition>

Your user account is associated with one or more [instances](./instances) that give access to IBM Quantum services. Additionally, a unique token is assigned to each account -- known as a *Cloud Resource Name* (CRN) -- allowing for IBM Quantum access from Qiskit.  For instructions to choose a specific instance, see [Connect to an instance](./instances#connect-instance).

    <Admonition type="note">
      The [IBM Quantum Platform dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) and the [Instances page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) list the instances that you can access.

## Set up to use IBM Cloud

1. Before setting up with IBM Cloud, ensure you are working in an active Python environment with the [Qiskit SDK and Qiskit Runtime installed](/docs/guides/install-qiskit#local).
1. If you do not already have one, set up an [IBM Cloud account.](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration?cm_sp=quantum&utm_content=quantum-next&target=https%3A%2F%2Fquantum.cloud.ibm.com&error_uri=)
   <Admonition type="note">
   You can have multiple IBM Cloud accounts.  You can access any of your IBM Cloud accounts at any time from the account switcher in the top header of the [IBM Quantum Platform interface](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com).
   </Admonition>
1. Create an instance, if necessary. Go to the [IBM Quantum Platform dashboard.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) If you have one or more instances shown, continue to the next step. Otherwise, follow these steps to create an instance.
   1. Make sure that you have the correct account selected from the account switcher in the top header. Click **Create instance**.
      * Choose a name and the plan to use.
      * If you are creating an instance of the Standard Plan, it is recommended that you set the total cost limit or the usage limit. (These values can be updated later.)
      * Scroll down to see the **Terms** link.  After reading the terms, agree to the license agreements by checking the box in the bottom right corner of the page, and click **Next**.
   1. On the Plan inheritance page, leave the default setting (toggle is not enabled) and click **Next** if you're setting up an Open instance.  If you are not setting up an Open instance and you want different QPUs to be available on this instance, enable the "Customize allocated compute resources" toggle, choose the QPUs you want this instance to be able to access, then click **Next**.
      <Admonition type="note">
      If you customize the allocated compute resources, the available QPUs will never be automatically updated, regardless of any changes made to the parent plan.  However, you can manually add or remove QPUs later.
      </Admonition>
   1. Choose whether you want an access group to be created for this instance and click **Create instance**.  For an Open instance, you probably don't need this access group, although creating one won't impact your usage unless you add another user to the group.  This access group allows other users (collaborators) to share the time allocated to this instance.  Collaborators can be added on the Users page.

      You can add or remove access groups at any time from IBM Cloud.  See [Setting up access groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-groups&interface=ui) for instructions.

    <Admonition type="note">
      If you are an administrator who needs to set up Qiskit Runtime on Cloud for your organization, refer to [Plan Qiskit Runtime for an organization](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/quantum-computing?topic=quantum-computing-considerations-set-up-runtime).
    </Admonition>

1. Find your access credentials.
    1. Find your API key. From the [dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/), create your API key, then copy it to a secure location so you can use it for authentication.
    2. Find your CRN from the Instances section of the dashboard. Click the icon to copy your CRN for the instance you want to use, then save it in a secure location so you can use it for authentication.

1. <span id="cloud-save"></span>**If you are working in a trusted Python environment (such as on a personal laptop or workstation),** use the `save_account()` method to save your credentials locally. ([Skip to the next step](#cloud-untrusted) if you are not using a trusted environment, such as a shared or public computer, to authenticate to IBM Cloud.) To use `save_account()`, activate a Python virtual environment. Then, run Python in your virtual environment and enter the following:


    ```python
    token = "<your-API-token>"
    ```

```python
  from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
  service = QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(
    token=token, # Your token is confidential.
    # Do not share your key in public code.
    instance="<IBM Cloud CRN>",
    name="<account-name>", # Optionally name this set of account credentials.
    set_as_default=True, # Optionally set these as your default credentials.
  )
```

1. Type `exit()`. From now on, whenever you need to authenticate to the service, you can load your credentials with `QiskitRuntimeService()`.  Test your setup and ensure that you can connect to the service:

    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    # If you named your credentials, optionally specify the name here, as follows:
    # QiskitRuntimeService(name='account-name')
    # If you don't specify a name, the default credentials are loaded.
    service = QiskitRuntimeService()
    ```

      * If you have saved credentials for both an IBM Quantum Platform account and an IBM Cloud account, IBM Cloud is the default account used when you initialize your account, unless you specify `set_as_default=True` in your IBM Quantum Platform account when you use the `save_account()` method.
      * If you are saving multiple accounts, consider using the `name` parameter to differentiate them.
      * Credentials are saved to `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json`.  Do not manually edit this file.
      * If you don't save your credentials, you must specify them every time you start a new session.

1. <span id="cloud-untrusted"></span>**Avoid executing code on an untrusted machine or an external cloud Python environment to minimize security risks.** If you must use an untrusted environment (on, for example, a public computer), change your API key after each use by deleting it on the [API keys page](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys) and creating a new one.

    <Admonition type="caution">
      **Protect your API key!** Never include your key in source code, Python script, or notebook file. When sharing code with others, ensure that your API key is not embedded directly within the Python script. Instead, share the script without the token and provide instructions for securely setting it up.

      If you accidentally share your key with someone or include it in version control like Git, immediately revoke your key by following the [Deleting an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#delete_user_key) topic on IBM Cloud.
    </Admonition>

    To initialize the service in this situation, you can use code like the following:

    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    service = QiskitRuntimeService(
      # Delete your key on the API keys page after entering this code:
      token="<IBM Cloud API key>",
      instance="<IBM Cloud CRN>"
      )
    ```

<span id="iqp-rest-api"></span>
## Set up to use IBM Quantum Platform with REST API

You can access quantum processors with REST APIs, enabling you to work with QPUs using any programming language or framework.

1. If you do not already have a user account, get one at the [IBM Quantum login page.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/login)
1. Create an API key on the [dashboard.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com)
1. Generate an IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) bearer token. This is a short-lived token  used to authenticate requests to the REST API. To generate one, call the [IAM Identity Services API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-identity-token-api#create-api-key) as shown in the following sample request:
<Tabs>

   <TabItem value="Curl" label="Curl">
   ```bash
   curl -X POST 'https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   -d 'grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey&apikey=MY_APIKEY'
   ```
   Expected Response
   ```text
   {
      "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUz......sgrKIi8hdFs",
      "refresh_token": "SPrXw5tBE3......KBQ+luWQVY=",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "expiration": 1473188353
   }
   ```
   </TabItem>

   <TabItem value="Python" label="Python">
   ```python
   # Use 'service' to invoke operations.
   import requests
   import json

   url = 'https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token'
   api_key = 'MY_APIKEY'
   headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlendcoded',
   }
   data = f'grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey&apikey={api_key}'
   response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

   # Bearer token to authorize requests to the REST API
   bearer_token = response.json()['access_token']
   ```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Admonition type="caution">

Because of the security risks posed by executing code that contains your API key, the recommended authentication method is to first create an environment variable for your API key, but only do so **if you are working in a trusted Python environment (such as on a personal laptop or workstation).**

[Skip to the next step](#rest-untrusted) if you are not using a trusted environment, such as a shared or public computer.

    To set the IQP_API_TOKEN environment variable in your system, you can add the following line to your shell profile (for example, .bashrc or .zshrc) or by setting it directly in your terminal:

    ```shell
    export IQP_API_TOKEN=<your-token>
    ```
    When you invoke the environment variable in your code, include `import os`, as in this example:

    ```python
    import os
    api_token = os.environ['IQP_API_TOKEN']
    ```

    Note that when creating an environment variable, your API key is still stored locally in plain text, and should be safeguarded.

4. Authenticate requests to the Qiskit Runtime REST API by including the CRN and bearer token to the request's headers.
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
   'https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/usage' \
   '-H accept: application/json' \
   '-H authorization: Bearer <BEARER_TOKEN>' \
   '-H Service-CRN: crn:v1:bluemix:public:quantum-computing:us-east:a/b947c1c5a9378d64aed96696e4d76e8e:a3a7f181-35aa-42c8-94d6-7c8ed6e1a94b::'
```
