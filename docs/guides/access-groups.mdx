# Set up access policies and access groups
<Admonition type="note">
This documentation is relevant to the new IBM Quantum&reg; Platform. If you need the previous version, return to the [IBM Quantum Platform Classic documentation.](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/admin/)
</Admonition>

When you create an instance in IBM Quantum Platform, an access group is automatically generated (unless you opt out) for access to that instance. If you want to customize an access group for an instance, or create other access groups, use the IBM&reg; Cloud console for [Access groups.](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/groups)

An _access group_ contains _policies_, which define the actions that access group members can take on specific resources, such as services.  In this guide, the resource is generally an IBM Quantum _service instance_.

<Admonition type="note">
After an access group is created, you can invite users to the group by using the IBM Quantum Platform [Access management](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/admin/access-groups) page in the left-hand menu.
</Admonition>

You can create an access group by using the IBM Cloud [user interface,](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-groups&interface=ui) [CLI,](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-groups&interface=cli) [API,](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-groups&interface=api) or [Terraform.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-groups&interface=terraform)

## Create an IBM Quantum Administrators access group
After setting up an account for your organization, it's recommended that you create an  IBM Quantum Administrators access group. This access group lets other users  create and manage instances, and manage user access for the Qiskit Runtime service.

When you create this access group, include the following policies:

- Qiskit Runtime service - Grant access to manage all IBM Quantum instances in the account and view account usage analytics.
  - Manager service access role
  - Administrator platform management access role
- All account management services - Grant access to list all the resource groups in the account.
  - Viewer platform management access role

<Admonition type="note">
  Users with the `viewer` platform management role on all account management services can also view all account management services, such as billing. To prevent this extra view access, use the IBM Cloud CLI to give them access to just Resource groups:
  ```cli
  ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create <group name> --roles Viewer --resource-type resource-group
  ```
</Admonition>

Examples:

### Use the IBM Cloud CLI

To create an _access group_ by using the CLI, use the [`ibmcloud iam access-group-create`(https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_policy_create)] command.

```cli
ibmcloud iam access-group-create GROUP_NAME [-d, --description DESCRIPTION]
```

To create an access group _policy_ by using the CLI, use the [`ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create`](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_policy_create) command.

- All IAM Account Management services (Administrator)

```cli
ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create GROUP_NAME {-f, --file @JSON_FILE | --roles ROLE_NAME1,ROLE_NAME2... [--service-name SERVICE_NAME] [--service-instance SERVICE_INSTANCE] [--region REGION] [--resource-type RESOURCE_TYPE] [--resource RESOURCE] [--resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID]}
```

You can use the following JSON code to create an Administrators access group:

```json
{
    "type": "access",
    "roles": [
        {
            "role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Administrator"
        }
    ],
    "resources": [
        {
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "accountId",
                    "value": "[ACCOUNT_ID]"
                },
                {
                    "name": "service_group_id",
                    "value": "IAM"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
- All Account Management services (viewer)
```json
{
    "type": "access",
    "roles": [
        {
            "role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer"
        }
    ],
    "resources": [
        {
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "accountId",
                    "value": "[ACCOUNT_ID]"
                },
                {
                    "name": "serviceType",
                    "value": "platform_service"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

- Qiskit Runtime Service (Manager, Administrator)
```json
{
    "type": "access",
    "roles": [
        {
            "role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Manager"
        },
        {
            "role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Administrator"
        }
    ],
    "resources": [
        {
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "accountId",
                    "value": "[ACCOUNT_ID]"
                },
                {
                    "name": "serviceName",
                    "value": "quantum-computing"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Use the IBM Cloud IAM user interface

As an account owner or administrator, you add the people in your organization to the IBM Cloud account and then assign them access permissions to use an instance.

1. Go to Manage > [Access (IAM)](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/overview) in the IBM Cloud console.
1. On the left panel in the **Manage access** section, click **Access groups**, then click **Create**.
1. In the **Create access group** window that opens, add a name and description that represent the group of users that you will invite.  For example, IBM Quantum Administrators. Click **Create**.

Next, create policies for the Qiskit Runtime service and for All IAM Account Management services.
1. In the access group just created, click the **Access** tab, then click **Assign access**.
1. In the **Create policy** page that opens, define these elements.
   - **Service** - Search for Qiskit Runtime and select it. Click **Next**.
   - **Resources** - Select **Specific resources**, and in the rest of the dropdowns, choose the following:
      - For **Attribute type**, select **Service Instance**.
      - For the operator, leave **string equals**.
      - For **Value**, select the instance you want to grant access to. Click **Next**.
   - **Roles and actions** - Select the following values:
      - For **Service access**, select  **Manager**.
      - For **Platform access**, select **Administrator**.

   At the bottom, click **Add**. You should see the policy on the right-hand panel. Click **Assign** at the bottom of the right-hand panel.

You have successfully created an access group with one policy.  Next, create a second policy for the same instance.

1. In the same access group, click the **Access** tab, then click **Assign access**.
1. In the **Create policy** page that opens, define these elements.
   - **Service** - Select **All IAM Account Management services**. Click **Next**.
   - **Roles and actions** - For Platform access, select **Viewer**, Click **Next**.
   At the bottom, click **Add**, then click **Assign**.

Next, invite users to the access group.  You can do this from the access group's **Users** page, or by using the IBM Quantum Platform [Access management](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/admin/access-groups) page.

Invited users will receive an email with an invitation to use this account with the defined access to the instance. After they accept the invitation, they will see a new account in their account switcher at the top of the IBM Quantum Platform page. After selecting the new account, they will see the shared instance.
