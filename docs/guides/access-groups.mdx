# Set up access policies and access groups
<Admonition type="note">
This documentation is relevant to the new IBM Quantum&reg; Platform. If you need the previous version, return to the [IBM Quantum Platform Classic documentation.](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/admin/)
</Admonition>

When you create an instance in IBM Quantum Platform, an access group is automatically generated (unless you opt out) for access to that instance. If you want to customize an access group for an instance, or create other access groups, use the IBM&reg; Cloud console for [Access groups.](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/groups)

An _access group_ contains _policies_, which define the actions that access group members can take on specific resources.  In this guide, the resource is always  an IBM Quantum _service instance_.

<Admonition type="note">
After an access group is created, you can invite users to the group by using the IBM Quantum Platform [Access management](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/access-groups) page in the left-hand menu.

## Create a Qiskit Runtime Administrators access group (JSON)

After setting up an account for your organization, it's recommended that you go to the IBM Cloud console for [Access groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/groups) and create a Qiskit Runtime Administrators access group. This access group gives access to other users to create and manage instances, and manage user access for the Qiskit Runtime service.

When you create this access group, include the following policies.  You can copy and paste the code into the JSON entry feature on the IAM console. Alternatively, you can make all of the selections on the user interface, as described in the [next section.](#ui)

- All IAM Account Management services (Administrator), required for inviting users, managing access groups and creating access policies

```json
{
    "type": "access",
    "roles": [
        {
            "role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Administrator"
        }
    ],
    "resources": [
        {
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "accountId",
                    "value": "[ACCOUNT_ID]"
                },
                {
                    "name": "service_group_id",
                    "value": "IAM"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
- All Account Management services (viewer), needed for listing all the resource groups in the account
```json
{
    "type": "access",
    "roles": [
        {
            "role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Viewer"
        }
    ],
    "resources": [
        {
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "accountId",
                    "value": "[ACCOUNT_ID]"
                },
                {
                    "name": "serviceType",
                    "value": "platform_service"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

- Qiskit Runtime Service (Manager, Administrator), required to manage all IBM Quantum instances in the account and view account usage analytics
```json
{
    "type": "access",
    "roles": [
        {
            "role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Manager"
        },
        {
            "role_id": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::role:Administrator"
        }
    ],
    "resources": [
        {
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "accountId",
                    "value": "[ACCOUNT_ID]"
                },
                {
                    "name": "serviceName",
                    "value": "quantum-computing"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Create an access group and invite users to an instance (user interface)

As an account owner or administrator, you add the people in your organization to the IBM Cloud account and then assign them access permissions to use an instance.

1. Go to Manage > [Access (IAM)](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/overview) in the IBM Cloud console.
1. On the left panel in the **Manage access** section, click **Access groups**, then click **Create**.
1. In the **Create access group** window that opens, add a name and description that represent the group of users that you will invite.  For example, the company name. Click **Create**.
1. In the access group just created, click the **Access** tab, then click **Assign access** at the top right.
1. In the **Create policy** page that opens, define these elements. Alternatively, you can copy and paste code into the JSON entry feature, as described in the [previous section.](#json)
   - **Service** - In the search field look for Qiskit Runtime and select it. Click **Next**.
   - **Resources** - Select **Specific resources**, and in the rest of the dropdowns, choose the following:
      - For **Attribute type**, select **Service Instance**.
      - For **Operator**, select **string equals**.
      - For **Value**, select the instance you want to grant access to. Click **Next**.
   - **Roles and actions** - Select the following values:
      - For **Service access**, select one of the following:
         - **Reader**, if the user only needs to view (but not send) jobs.
         - **Writer**, if the user needs to send, update, and delete jobs.
         - **Manager**, if in addition to Writer and Reader actions, the user needs to update the instance `max cost limit`.
         - Your own custom role (optional), defined on the [Roles](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/roles) page.
      - For **Platform access**, select **Viewer**.
   - **Conditions (optional)**. Click **Review**.

   At the bottom, click **Add**. You should see the policy on the right-hand panel. Click **Assign** at the bottom of the right-hand panel. You have successfully created an access group for your instance.
1. On the left panel in the **Manage identities** section, click **Users**. Then, at the top right click **Invite users**.
   - Enter the email addresses of your users separated by commas, spaces, or line breaks.
   - Select **Access groups** as the way to assign access.
   - In the access groups table, select the one you just created and click **Add**. You will see the Access summary on the right-hand panel. Click **Invite** at the bottom of the Access summary panel.

Users will receive an email with an invitation to use this account with the defined access to the instance. After they accept the invitation, they will see a new account in their account switcher at the top of the IBM Quantum Platform page. After selecting the new account, they will see the shared instance.
