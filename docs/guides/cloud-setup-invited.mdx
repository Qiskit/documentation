# Set up your IBM Cloud account - invited users

If you do not have an invitation from an administrator to join an account, follow the steps in [Set up your IBM Cloud account](/docs/guides/cloud-setup) instead.

You can run workloads on IBM&reg; quantum processing units (QPUs) by setting up an account on IBM Cloud&reg;. You will also need to [install and set up Qiskit and Qiskit Runtime](/docs/guides/install-qiskit#local).


Your user account is associated with one or more [instances](./instances) that give access to IBM Quantum services. Additionally, a unique token is assigned to each account -- known as a *Cloud Resource Name* (CRN) -- allowing for IBM Quantum access from Qiskit.  For instructions to choose a specific instance, see [Connect to an instance](./instances#connect-instance).

    <Admonition type="note">
      The [IBM Quantum Platform dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) and the [Instances page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) list the instances that you can access.

## Set up to use IBM Cloud

### Before you begin

1. Ensure you are working in an active Python environment with the [Qiskit SDK and Qiskit Runtime installed](/docs/guides/install-qiskit#local).

1. Accept the email invitation.
1. If you do not already have one, set up an [IBM Cloud account.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/registration)
   <Admonition type="note">
   You can have multiple IBM Cloud accounts.  You can access any of your IBM Cloud accounts at any time from the account switcher in the top header of the [IBM Quantum Platform interface](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com).
   </Admonition>

<span id="access-credentials"></span>
### 1. Find your access credentials
    1. Find your API key. From the [dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/), create your API key, then copy it to a secure location so you can use it for authentication.
    2. Optional: Find your CRN from the Instances section of the dashboard. Click the icon to copy your CRN for the instance you want to use, then save it in a secure location so you can use it to identify the instance.

<span id="cloud-save"></span>
### 2. Initialize the service (trusted environment)
If you are working in a trusted Python environment (such as on a personal laptop or workstation), use the `save_account()` method to save your credentials locally, then use them to initialize the service.

1. Activate a Python virtual environment, run Python in your virtual environment, and enter the following:

    ```python
    token = "<your-API-token>"
    ```
2. Initialize the service.
<Admonition type="Note">
When an instance CRN or name is passed in, only backends and jobs from that instance are available.  If an instance is not specified (allowed in Qiskit Runtime v0.40.1 and later), all backends and jobs across all instances in your account are available. In this case, when a backend is specified, an instance that can access that backend is found and used.
</Admonition>

```python
  from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
  service = QiskitRuntimeService.save_account(
    token=token, # Your token is confidential.
    # Do not share your key in public code.
    instance="<IBM Cloud CRN or instance name>", # Optionally specify the instance to use.
    plans_preference="['plan-type1', 'plan-type2']", # Optionally set the types of plans to prioritize.  This is ignored if the instance is specified.
    region="<region>", # Optionally set the region to prioritize. This is ignored if the instance is specified.
    name="<account-name>", # Optionally name this set of account credentials.
    set_as_default=True, # Optionally set these as your default credentials.
  )
```


      ```python
        from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    # If you named your credentials, optionally specify the name here, as follows:
    # QiskitRuntimeService(name='account-name')
    # If you don't specify a name, the default credentials are loaded.
    service = QiskitRuntimeService()
       ```
      * If you have saved credentials for both an IBM Quantum Platform account and an IBM Cloud account, IBM Cloud is the default account used when you initialize your account, unless you specify `set_as_default=True` in your IBM Quantum Platform account when you use the `save_account()` method.
      * If you are saving multiple accounts, consider using the `name` parameter to differentiate them.
      * Credentials are saved to `$HOME/.qiskit/qiskit-ibm.json`.  Do not manually edit this file.
      * If you don't save your credentials, you must specify them every time you start a new session.

<span id="cloud-untrusted"></span>
### 2. Initialize the service (untrusted environment)
    Follow these instructions to authenticate to IBM Cloud if you are not using a trusted environment.
    **Avoid executing code on an untrusted machine or an external cloud Python environment to minimize security risks.** If you must use an untrusted environment (on, for example, a shared or public computer), change your API key after each use by deleting it on the [API keys page](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys) and creating a new one.

    <Admonition type="caution">
      **Protect your API key!** Never include your key in source code, Python script, or notebook file. When sharing code with others, ensure that your API key is not embedded directly within the Python script. Instead, share the script without the token and provide instructions for securely setting it up.

      If you accidentally share your key with someone or include it in version control like Git, immediately revoke your key by following the [Deleting an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#delete_user_key) topic on IBM Cloud.
    </Admonition>

    To initialize the service in this situation, use code like the following:

    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

    service = QiskitRuntimeService(
      # Delete your key on the API keys page after entering this code:
      token="<IBM Cloud API key>",
      # Optionally specify an instance to use
      instance="<IBM Cloud CRN or instance name>"
      )
    ```
### 3. Optional: Configure your firewall.

    If necessary, use [this information](/docs/guides/quickstart-steps-org#firewall) to enable access to the IBM Quantum API endpoints.

<span id="iqp-rest-api"></span>
## Set up to use IBM Quantum Platform with REST API

You can access quantum processors with REST APIs, enabling you to work with QPUs using any programming language or framework.

### 1. Get access

1. If you do not already have a user account, get one at the [IBM Quantum login page.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/login)
1. Create an API key on the [dashboard.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com)
1. Generate an IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) bearer token. This is a short-lived token  used to authenticate requests to the REST API. To generate one, call the [IAM Identity Services API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/iam-identity-token-api#create-api-key) as shown in the following sample request:
<Tabs>

   <TabItem value="Curl" label="Curl">
   ```bash
   curl -X POST 'https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token' \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
   -d 'grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey&apikey=MY_APIKEY'
   ```
   Expected Response
   ```text
   {
      "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUz......sgrKIi8hdFs",
      "refresh_token": "SPrXw5tBE3......KBQ+luWQVY=",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "expiration": 1473188353
   }
   ```
   </TabItem>

   <TabItem value="Python" label="Python">
   ```python
   # Use 'service' to invoke operations.
   import requests
   import json

   url = 'https://iam.cloud.ibm.com/identity/token'
   api_key = 'MY_APIKEY'
   headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlendcoded',
   }
   data = f'grant_type=urn:ibm:params:oauth:grant-type:apikey&apikey={api_key}'
   response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=data)

   # Bearer token to authorize requests to the REST API
   bearer_token = response.json()['access_token']
   ```
   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Choose an authentication method

Choose the appropriate authentication method, depending on your working environment:

* [Create an environment variable for your API key (trusted Python environments)](#environment_variable)
* [Use your API key directly (untrusted environment)](#rest-untrusted)

<span id="environment_variable"></span>
#### Create an environment variable (trusted environment)

1.  To set the IQP_API_TOKEN environment variable in your system, you can add the following line to your shell profile (for example, .bashrc or .zshrc) or by setting it directly in your terminal:

    ```shell
    export IQP_API_TOKEN=<your-token>
    ```
    When you invoke the environment variable in your code, include `import os`, as in this example:

    ```python
    import os
    api_token = os.environ['IQP_API_TOKEN']
    ```

    Note that when creating an environment variable, your API key is still stored locally in plain text, and should be safeguarded.
1. Authenticate requests to the Qiskit Runtime REST API by including the CRN and bearer token to the request's headers.
```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
   'https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/usage' \
   '-H accept: application/json' \
   '-H authorization: Bearer <BEARER_TOKEN>' \
   '-H Service-CRN: crn:v1:bluemix:public:quantum-computing:us-east:a/b947c1c5a9378d64aed96696e4d76e8e:a3a7f181-35aa-42c8-94d6-7c8ed6e1a94b::'
```

<span id="rest-untrusted"></span>
#### Use your API key directly (untrusted environment)

Follow these steps if you must use an untrusted environment, such as a public computer.
<Admonition type="caution">
  When sharing code with others, ensure that your API key is not embedded directly within the Python script. Instead, share the script without the key and provide instructions for securely setting it up.

  If you accidentally share your key with someone or include it in version control like Git, immediately revoke your key by following the [Deleting an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#delete_user_key) topic on IBM Cloud.
</Admonition>

1. Authenticate requests to the Qiskit Runtime REST API by including the CRN and bearer token to the request's headers.

  ```python
# Refresh your API key on the dashboard after using the code as follows:
api_key = "<your-key>"
  ```
1. Change your API key after each use by following the [Deleting an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#delete_user_key) instructions on IBM Cloud.

### 3. Optional: Configure your firewall

    If necessary, use [this information](/docs/guides/quickstart-steps-org#firewall) to enable access to the IBM Quantum API endpoints.
