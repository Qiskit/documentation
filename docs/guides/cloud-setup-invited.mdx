# Set up your IBM Cloud account - invited users

If you do not have an invitation from an administrator to join an account that an administrator set up, contact your administrator.  If you need to set up your own account, follow the steps in [Set up your IBM Cloud account](/docs/guides/cloud-setup).

You can run workloads on IBM&reg; quantum processing units (QPUs) by setting up an account on IBM Cloud&reg;. You will also need to [install and set up Qiskit and Qiskit Runtime](/docs/guides/install-qiskit#local).


Your user account is associated with one or more [instances](./instances), identified by _Cloud Resource Names_ (CRNs) that give access to IBM Quantum services. Additionally, a unique API token (also called a key) is assigned to each account, allowing for IBM Quantum access from Qiskit.  For instructions to choose a specific instance, see [Connect to an instance](./instances#connect-instance).

    <Admonition type="note">
      The [IBM Quantum Platform dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) and the [Instances page](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) list the instances that you can access.

## Set up to use IBM Cloud

### Before you begin

1. Accept the email invitation.
1. Log in with an IBMid or Google account.  **The profile that you use to log in to IBM Cloud or IBM Quantum Platform in this step is not your IBM Cloud account.**  After logging in, confirm your information and accept the invitation to join the account.
1. Navigate back to [IBM Quantum Platform.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com)
1. Make sure that the correct account and region are selected in the account switcher in the header, as shown in the following image.
    * Choose the account that was invited in the email.
    * The region controls where your jobs are run and where the job data is kept. You can access either region by using the same API key, but you can only see and access the instances that were created in the region that you're logged in to.

    ![The IBM Quantum Platform header is shown.  The account switcher is to the right of the search bar.  The region switcher is to the right of the account switcher.](/docs/images/guides/cloud-setup/IQP-Header.svg 'IBM Quantum Platform header')


<span id="access-credentials"></span>
### 1. Find your access credentials
    1. Find your API key. From the [dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/), create your API key, then copy it to a secure location so you can use it for authentication.
    2. Optional: Find the instance you want to use from the [Instances](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/instances) page. Click the icon to copy its CRN, then save it in a secure location so you can use it to identify the instance.

### 2. Connect Qiskit with your service instance
Follow the appropriate steps to connect Qiskit with your Qiskit Runtime service instance:
- [Initialize your Qiskit Runtime service account](initialize-account): Visit this guide if you are working in a trusted environment; such as a personal laptop.
- [Initialize the service in an untrusted environment](/docs/guides/cloud-setup-untrusted): Visit this guide if you are not using a secure environment. For example, if you are using a public comptuer.
- Follow [these instructions](/docs/guides/cloud-setup-rest-api) if you want to connect by using the REST API instead of using Qiskit.
