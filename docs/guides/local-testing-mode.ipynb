    "Use local testing mode (available with `qiskit-ibm-runtime` v0.22.0 or later) to test programs before fine-tuning them and sending them to real quantum hardware.  After using local testing mode to verify your program, all you need to change is the backend name to run it on a QPU.\n",

    "- **Fake backends**: The [fake backends](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/fake-provider)  in ``qiskit_ibm_runtime.fake_provider`` mimic the behaviors of IBM&reg; QPUs by using QPU snapshots. The QPU snapshots contain important information about the QPU, such as the coupling map, basis gates, and qubit properties, which are useful for testing the transpiler and performing noisy simulations of the QPU. The noise model from the snapshot is automatically applied during simulation.\n",
    "- **Aer simulator**: Simulators from [Qiskit Aer](/docs/guides/simulate-with-qiskit-aer) provide higher-performance simulation that can handle larger circuits and [custom noise models](/docs/guides/build-noise-models). A list of simulation method options are available when you use `AerSimulator` in local testing mode. See the [Clifford simulation mode example](#clifford-sim), which demonstrates how to efficiently simulate Clifford circuits with a large number of qubits.\n",

    "    * ``\"matrix_product_state\"``: A tensor-network statevector simulator that uses a Matrix Product State (MPS) representation for the state. This can be done with or without truncating the MPS bond dimensions, depending on the simulator options. The default behavior is no truncation.\n",
