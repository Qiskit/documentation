# Configure IBM Quantum Platform for an organization
<Admonition type="note">
This documentation is relevant to the new IBM Quantum&reg; Platform. If you need the previous version, return to the [IBM Quantum Platform Classic documentation.](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/admin/)
</Admonition>

Follow these steps to set up IBM Quantum Platform.

<span id="iam-org"></span>
## Configure IAM settings

First, configure the following settings in the administrator's IAM account. To review and configure these settings, go to [Manage → IAM → Settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/settings).

* **User list visibility** determines whether users can see each other, regardless of project assignment. The `enabled` setting restricts user visibility. That is, users in your account cannot see each other, even if they can access the same resources. Choose the appropriate value for your environment. See [Controlling user visibility](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iam-user-setting) for more information.
* **API key creation** controls whether users can create API keys. In IBM Quantum Platform, it is common to use API keys. If API keys are being used, choose `disabled`. Alternatively, you can give specific permissions to each user.

## (Optional) Create resource groups

Skip this step if you are using access groups that directly reference IBM Quantum service instances.

If you chose to use resource groups, go to [Manage → Account → Resource groups (in Account resources)](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/resource-groups) and click **Create**.

<span id="create-instance-org"></span>
## Create IBM Quantum service instances

If you already created IBM Quantum service instances, skip this step.

* If you are using resource groups, make sure to create the service instances on the appropriate resource group.
* The service instance name, such as `QR-ml`, is needed for access group references.

Follow the steps in [Set up to use IBM Cloud](/guides/cloud-setup#cloud) for instructions.

## Create access groups for projects

First, create a custom role that allows users to perform actions to work with IBM Quantum service instances for each access group. Next, create an access group for each project and give that group the minimum set of permissions that are required to work with the project resources. In a later step, you will map users to access groups.

Follow these steps to set up an access group:

1. Create a custom role.
   1. From [Manage → IAM → Roles](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/roles), click `Create`.
   2. Enter a name, ID, description, and select `Qiskit Runtime` for the service.
   3. Select the following roles, then click **Create**.
      * quantum-computing.device.read
      * quantum-computing.job.cancel
      * quantum-computing.job.create
      * quantum-computing.job.read
      * quantum-computing.program.create
      * quantum-computing.program.delete
      * quantum-computing.program.read
      * quantum-computing.program.update
      * quantum-computing.user.logout
      * Select quantum-computing.job.delete if you want to allow users to delete jobs.

2. Create an access group.
   1. Go to [Manage → IAM → Access groups](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/groups) and click **Create**.
   2. Enter a name, like `project-ml`, and a description.
3. Assign access to the group.
   1. Select the Access tab and click **Assign access**.
   2. In the Service list, search for **Qiskit Runtime** and select it, then click **Next**.
   3. In Resources, select **Specific resources**. For Attribute type, choose **Service Instance**.
   4. From the drop-down list, select the service instance that you want to add to the access group, for example, `QR-ml`. If you are using resource groups, select the resource group instead of selecting individual service instances. Click **Next**.
   5. For Roles and actions, select **Viewer** and the custom role that was created previously. Click **Add**, then **Assign**.
   6. Repeat this step if you want to give an access group permission to several service instances.

## Set up your ID provider and assign users

Follow the steps in the appropriate topic, depending on the ID provider you chose to use:

* [Use IBM Cloud&reg; as the ID provider for users that have IBM Cloud accounts](/guides/manage-cloud-users)
* [Use IBM Cloud as the ID provider for users that do not have IBM Cloud accounts](/guides/manage-appid#id-cloud)
* [Use an ID provider other than IBM Cloud for users that do not have IBM Cloud accounts](/guides/manage-appid#id-provider)
