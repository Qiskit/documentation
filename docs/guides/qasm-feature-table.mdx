# OpenQASM 3 feature table

Below is a list of the `OpenQASM 3` language features.

For more details on these capabilities, see the [OpenQASM 3.X Live Specification](https://openqasm.com/).

Key:

*   ❌ Not supported
*   🟡 Partial support
*   ✅ Supported

The "supported" mark meaning depends on the column:

* *Qiskit SDK*: The feature can be parsed by [`qiskit.qasm3.loads`](/docs/api/qiskit/qasm3) (by using the `qiskit-qasm3-import` extension) and represented in a [`QuantumCircuit`.](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit)

  The feature can be exported to OpenQASM 3 by [`qiskit.qasm3.dumps`.](/docs/api/qiskit/qasm3#dumps)
* *IBM Qiskit Runtime*: A circuit containing the corresponding Qiskit feature can be successfully executed on hardware through IBM&reg; Qiskit Runtime.

## Notes

<span id="1"></span>
1.  These OpenQASM 3 program features have no impact on the execution and Qiskit strips them
    out as part of parsing the files.  Files that use them can be submitted but they will have
    no effect. For `include` files, `stdgates.inc` is currently supported as input to Qiskit,
    and backend execution always requires circuits to have been compiled to the backend Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), where
    `include` files are irrelevant.

<span id="2"></span>
2. Qiskit SDK supports parsing and dumping OpenQASM 3 files with any ``qubit`` declarations.  For
   execution on hardware, only circuits defined in terms of hardware qubits (for example, `$0`) are valid.
   Qiskit SDK automatically outputs OpenQASM 3 in terms of the supported hardware-qubit
   identifiers if the circuit was transpiled for a backend with layout information.

<span id="3"></span>
3. `bit`- and `bit[n]`-typed variable declarations in Qiskit SDK correspond to `Clbit` and
   `ClassicalRegister` declarations.

<span id="4"></span>
4. As of July 2025, Qiskit SDK (through `qiskit-qasm3-import` v0.6.0) does not support parsing
   OpenQASM 3 files that contain variable declarations, and has very limited support for parsing
   variable expressions.  `QuantumCircuit`, however, can represent local variables of a
   restricted set of types, can represent many different expressions on these types, and supports
   outputting them to OpenQASM 3.  In general, most of what Qiskit can represent in its
   expression system can be executed on suitable dynamic circuits hardware.  See [the Qiskit
   documentation of the `qiskit.circuit.classical` module](/docs/api/qiskit/circuit_classical)
   for the most up-to-date information.

<span id="5"></span>
5. Qiskit SDK can represent register aliasing for both quantum and classical registers, but it is
   strongly discouraged to use aliasing of classical registers.  Most expressions on classical
   registers do not work with aliases, and aliased classical registers are not supported for
   execution on hardware.  The Qiskit OpenQASM 3 parser can resolve `let` alias statements that bind
   the result of register concantenation.

<span id="6"></span>
6. Qiskit SDK supports explicit delays via `QuantumCircuit.delay`, and circuit boxes
   (`QuantumCircuit.box`) can also have explicit durations.  These durations can include classical
   expressions of `stretch` variables.  Qiskit SDK (as of July 2025 through `qiskit-qasm3-import`
   v0.6.0) does not support parsing declarations of type `duration` or type `stretch` from
   OpenQASM 3 files.  Hardware has limited support for durations including `stretch`.

<span id="7"></span>
7. Circuits must be transpiled to the backend ISA to run on IBM hardware.  This precludes
   custom `gate` definitions and higher-level constructs like gate modifiers (such as `inv @`) from
   being valid for execution on hardware verbatim, but the `transpile` process resolves them
   into valid ISA circuits.  Qiskit SDK (as of July 2025, through `qiskit-qasm3-import`
   v0.6.0) will eagerly evaluate gate modifiers during the parse, so these will not be
   evident in the resulting `QuantumCircuit`, potentially at a runtime cost.

<span id="8"></span>
8. Qiskit SDK can represent structured control flow and export this to OpenQASM 3.  The `continue`
   and `break` statements can technically be represented by Qiskit, but are not well supported even
   within Qiskit SDK.  `for` loops in Qiskit v2.1.0
   are not well supported.  Nested control
   flow (such as an `if` inside another `if`, or an `else if` statement) is not eligible for execution
   on hardware.

<span id="9"></span>
9. Qiskit SDK supports declaring any supported classical type as an `input` variable on the circuit.
   Such variables are not currently eligible for execution on hardware, and cannot be loaded by
   the Qiskit OpenQASM 3 importer.  Unbound `Parameter` objects present in the `QuantumCircuit` are exported as `input float[64]` variables.  Certain runtime configuration options can enable executing such circuits on some backends.
