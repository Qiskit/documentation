# Execute on target hardware

![../\_images/execute.svg](/images/qiskit-patterns/execute.svg)

The "execute on hardware" step of a Qiskit pattern involves running your circuits on hardware
and produces the outputs of the quantum computation. The ISA circuits produced in
the previous step can be executed using either a Sampler or Estimator primitive from
Qiskit Runtime, initialized locally on your computer or from a cluster or other
heterogeneous compute environment. These can be executed in a Batch, which allows
parallel transpilation for classical computational efficiency - or a Session,
which allows iterative tasks to be implemented efficiently without queuing delays.

During this step, there is also the option to configure certain error suppression and
mitigation techniques provided by Qiskit Runtime.

Depending on whether you are using the Sampler or Estimator primitive, the outcome of this step
will be different. If using the Sampler, the output will be per-shot measurements
in the form of bitstrings. If using the Estimator, the output will be
expectation values of observables corresponding to physical quantities or cost functions.
