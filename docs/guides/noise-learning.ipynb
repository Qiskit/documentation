    "The error mitigation techniques [PEA](./error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#probabilistic-error-amplification-pea) and [PEC](./error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#probabilistic-error-cancellation-pec) both utilize a noise learning component based on a [Pauli-Lindblad noise model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09866), which is typically managed during execution after submitting one or more jobs through `qiskit-ibm-runtime` without any local access to the fitted noise model. However, as of `qiskit-ibm-runtime` 0.27.1, a [`NoiseLearner`](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/noise-learner) and associated  [`NoiseLearnerOptions`](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-noise-learner-options) class have been created to obtain the results of these noise learning experiments. These results can then be stored locally as a `NoiseLearnerResult` and used as input in later experiments. This page provides an overview of its usage and the associated options available.\n",

    "The `NoiseLearner` class performs experiments that characterize noise processes based on a Pauli-Lindblad noise model for one (or more) circuits. It possesses a `run()` method that executes the learning experiments and takes as input either a list of circuits or a [PUB](./primitive-input-output#overview-of-pubs), and returns a `NoiseLearnerResult` containing the learned noise channels and metadata about the job(s) submitted. Below is a code snippet demonstrating the usage of the helper program."
