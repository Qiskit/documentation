To ensure fairness and help control costs, there is a maximum amount of time each Qiskit Runtime job can run. If a job exceeds this time limit, it is forcibly canceled and a `RuntimeJobMaxTimeoutError` exception is raised.

   If you use Qiskit Runtime on IBM Cloud&reg;, the session or batch is immediately terminated when the cost limit is reached.

## Job maximum execution time

The maximum execution time for a job is the smaller of these values:

- The value set for `max_execution_time`
- The service-determined job timeout value

The `max_execution_time` value is based on _quantum time_, not wall clock time. Quantum time is the time spent by the QPU complex to process the job. Simulator jobs use wall clock time because they do not have quantum time.

Set the maximum execution time (in seconds) on the job options, as shown in the following example.  See [Specify options](/guides/specify-runtime-options) for information about setting options.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import EstimatorV2 as Estimator

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)

estimator = Estimator(mode=backend)

estimator.options.max_execution_time = 2500
```

You can also find how much quantum time completed jobs have used by returning the job metrics as follows:

```python
# Find quantum time used by the job
print(f"Quantum time used by job {job.job_id()} was {job.metrics()['usage']['quantum_seconds']} seconds")
```

### QPU maximum execution time

The QPU calculates an appropriate job timeout value based on the input circuits and options. This QPU-calculated timeout is capped at 3 hours to ensure fair device usage. If a `max_execution_time` is also specified for the job, the lesser of the two values is used.

For example, if you specify `max_execution_time=5000` (approximately 83 minutes), but the QPU determines it should not take more than 5 minutes (300 seconds) to execute the job, then the job is canceled after 5 minutes.

## Batch maximum execution time

When a batch is started, it is assigned a maximum time to live (maximum TTL) value. After this TTL is reached, the batch is terminated, any jobs that are already running continue running, and any queued jobs that remain in the batch are put into a failed state.

Batches also have an interactive time to live (interactive TTL) value between jobs that cannot be configured. If you don't explicitly close a batch, it is deactivated after the interactive TTL expires and can be reactivated at any time until it reaches its  maximum TTL.

For instructions to work with these values, see [Run jobs in a batch.](/guides/run-jobs-batch)

<span id="session-max-time"></span>
## Session maximum execution time

When a session is started, it is assigned a maximum TTL value that determines how long a session can run. After this TTL is reached, the session is terminated, any jobs that are already running continue running, and any queued jobs that remain in the session are put into a failed state.

There is also an interactive TTL value that cannot be configured.  If no session jobs are queued within that window, the session is temporarily deactivated.

For instructions to work with these values, see [Run jobs in a session.](/guides/run-jobs-session)

## Other limitations
<LegacyContent>
*   Inputs to jobs cannot exceed 64MB in size.
*   Open Plan users can use up to 10 minutes of QPU execution time per month (resets at 00:00 UTC on the first of each month). QPU execution time is the amount of time that the QPU is dedicated to processing your job. You can track your monthly usage on the [Platform dashboard,](https://quantum.ibm.com/)  [IBM Quantum&reg; Platform Workloads page,](https://quantum.ibm.com/workloads) and [Account](https://quantum.ibm.com/account) page.
