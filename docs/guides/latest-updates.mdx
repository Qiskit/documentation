### The next evolution of IBM Quantum Platform: How to prepare for the transition

We are excited to announce a major evolution coming to IBM Quantum Platform, one that will bring a host of new features and provide Open Plan users with access to our state-of-the-art Heron processor.

We are upgrading the Platform as part of our effort to deliver an enterprise-grade cloud experience that leverages new backend infrastructure for enhanced features, increased performance, and the latest data privacy and security measures. These changes lay a foundation to support the scaling of our services alongside the [IBM Quantum Roadmap,](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/technology#roadmap) and to enable the increasingly complex workloads that are required to achieve quantum advantage. 

#### 26 February 2025

- Today, we are releasing an early access version of the upgraded experience, and invite you to [open an account and explore the new interface](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com). We will continue to roll out updates over the coming months, with the end goal of creating an experience that looks and feels like the classic version of IBM Quantum Platform, but with greater functionality. We will eventually sunset IBM Quantum Platform classic, so stay tuned for updates.

- Please note: If your IBM Quantum Platform access falls under a plan administrator (Premium Plan, Dedicated Service, Startup Program, etc.), you will receive guided migration support through your administrator in the coming months. In the meantime, you are welcome to [create a free Open Plan account to explore the new platform.](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com)

## Latest release summaries

{/* release summaries written by product owners */}

### Qiskit SDK v1.3.0

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit SDK release notes](/api/qiskit/release-notes).*

The latest Qiskit version, 1.3, has just been released on [GitHub](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/releases/tag/1.3.0) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/). The main changes include the following:

- We improved performance by porting additional key components to Rust, including:
  - Core data structures, such as `DAGCircuit` or `Target`
  - Transpiler passes, including `BasisTranslator`, `CommutationAnalysis`, or `UnitarySynthesis`, making the transpilation around six times faster compared to v1.2.4
  - Circuit library and synthesis routines, such as `PauliEvolutionGate` or `n_local`

- The circuit library is now faster and allows for better high-level optimization, in particular with context-aware updates to `HighLevelSynthesis`.

- Python 3.13 is now officially supported. Python 3.9 is now the *minimum* supported version.

Explore the [v1.3 release notes](/api/qiskit/release-notes/1.3), and read about this release on the [IBM Quantum blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-1-3-release-summary).

### Qiskit Runtime client 0.37.0

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit Runtime client release notes](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes).*

**Highlights from the 0.37.0 (13 March 2025) version release**

#### Deprecation

The `IBMBackend` attributes `max_shots` and `max_experiments`, as well as the property `max_circuits` have all been deprecated. Previously, these attribute values represented the maximum number of shots and circuits that could be submitted in one job. See [job limits](/guides/job-limits#job-limits) for details.

#### New features

qiskit-ibm-runtime is now compatible with Qiskit v2.0. This means that classes and methods removed in Qiskit v2.0 have also been removed or handled accordingly.  The `pulse` and `channel` related changes are highlighted in the following list. See the [Pulse migration guide](/migration-guides/pulse-migration) for details.

   - `Channel` methods in `IBMBackend` have been removed.
   - The backend configuration class `PulseBackendConfiguration` has been removed, so all backends will now be returned as `QasmBackendConfiguration`.
   - `PulseDefaults` (backend defaults) can still be retrieved but they are no longer necessary when creating a backend `Target`.


See the full [0.37.0 release notes](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes#0370-2025-03-13).
{/* use url format /api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes#0XYZ to link to the specific 0.XY.Z version of the release notes */}

### Qiskit Transpiler Service client v0.3.0

We’re pleased to share that the beta release of the Qiskit Transpiler Service is now available to all IBM Quantum&reg; Premium Plan users.

The Qiskit Transpiler Service leverages the resources of IBM Cloud&reg; to provide users with the latest transpilation capabilities from the Qiskit SDK. It offers a Python library that helps users seamlessly integrate the service into their current Qiskit patterns and workflows. Perhaps most importantly, the service invites users to experiment with new and improved AI-powered transpiler passes — cutting-edge tools that might be faster and produce better results than traditional transpilation methods.

On the IBM Quantum blog, we take a deep dive into the new beta release with a special focus on the new AI-powered passes. The blog includes detailed explanations showing how to use the Qiskit Transpiler Service for both full circuit transpilation and standalone AI-powered passes, with code examples for each. [Take a look.](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/ai-transpiler-passes)

{/* no other release notes available yet */}

### Qiskit Functions Catalog Service client v0.1.0

Introducing the Qiskit Functions preview, for IBM Quantum Premium Plan users. To get started, `pip install qiskit-ibm-catalog`, and explore the [Qiskit Functions documentation](/guides/functions). With the Qiskit Functions Catalog client, you can submit workloads to abstracted services designed to accelerate your research - sign in with your existing IBM Quantum Platform credentials.

Premium Plan users can get started right away with the IBM&reg; Circuit function, or request access to circuit or application functions from our partners.

## Qiskit Runtime service updates

This summary of the latest changes to the Qiskit Runtime service applies to anyone using Qiskit Runtime, regardless of how you communicate with the service (using qiskit-ibm-runtime or otherwise), or which version of the client SDK you use.

### 3 February 2025

Pulse-level control on all IBM Quantum processors has been removed.  Additionally, the pulse module is scheduled for removal in Qiskit SDK v2.0.  Instead, you can use fractional gates that are now built into the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). For full details and help migrating your code, refer to [Migrate from Qiskit Pulse to fractional gates.](/migration-guides/pulse-migration)

### 2 February 2025

Starting 2 June 2025 and continuing through the year, IBM Quantum will begin a gradual rollout of new features to [dynamic circuits](/guides/classical-feedforward-and-control-flow) that will enable them at the utility scale.
Improvements include the following:

- A 75x speedup in execution by using the [Gen3 engine stack](/guides/runtime-options-overview#experimental-option-note)
- Parallel execution of branches, which reduces circuit duration and improves result quality
- Improvement in mid-circuit measurement
- Better integration with dynamical decoupling
- More visibility of circuit timing information

To accelerate the rollout, the following capabilities are now deprecated and will be no longer supported on or around 2 June 2025:

- The `while`, `for`, and `switch` control flow constructs
- The ability to use control flow instructions inside the body of a branch (as in, nested control flow)
- Conditional measurements


### 7 January 2025

The rollout of the Gen3 engine stack begins today. This engine stack gives a 75x speedup in execution.  The rollout will be done on one QPU at a time, where a percentage of the jobs on the QPU will use the Gen3 path.  You can also force the Gen3 path using the [`gen3-turbo` experimental option.](/guides/runtime-options-overview#available-options) Note that this engine stack is not compatible with fractional gates, pulse gates, or dynamic circuits.

### 15 October 2024

Support for `backend.run` has ended. See the appropriate [migration guide](/migration-guides/qiskit-runtime) if you have not yet migrated to using primitives.

### 1 October 2024

Parameterized delay gates have been deprecated.

### 15 August 2024

- Probabilistic error amplification (PEA) error mitigation method is now available for Estimator V2. See the [`ZneOptions` API reference](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-zne-options) for more details.
- A new helper program `noise-learner` is now available. It allows characterizing the noise processes affecting the gates in one or more circuits of interest, based on the Pauli-Lindblad noise model. The output noise model can then be passed to Estimator via the `layer_noise_model` option.
- V1 primitives are no longer supported.

### 3 July 2024

The following endpoints are deprecated and will be removed on or after 3 October 2024: [`GET /stream/jobs`](/api/runtime/tags/jobs#tags__jobs__operations__get_stream_jobs_state_updates) and [`GET /stream/jobs/{id}`](/api/runtime/tags/jobs#tags__jobs__operations__get_stream_job_logs_jid). This removal has the following impacts:

- After the endpoints are removed, `job.stream_results()` and `job.interim_results()` will be removed from the [qiskit-ibm-runtime](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime) client.
- Additional methods, such as `job.result()` currently use the deprecated endpoints.  Upgrade to `qiskit_ibm_runtime` 0.25 or later before the endpoints are removed to avoid disruption.

### 18 June 2024

The `optimization_level` option is deprecated for Estimator V2 and will be removed no sooner than 30 September 2024.

### 3 June 2024

Probabilistic error amplification (PEA) error mitigation method is now available as an experimental option for Estimator V2. See the [`EstimatorOptions` API reference](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-estimator-options) for more details.

### 28 March 2024

Qiskit Runtime primitives now support OpenQASM 3 as the input format for circuits and standard JSON output format. See [Qiskit Runtime REST API](/api/runtime) for examples.

## Qiskit Functions Catalog updates

### 16 September 2024

The Qiskit Functions Catalog preview provides access to Premium Plan users to explore the available functions, including those written by IBM and those written by other members of our ecosystem. The catalog contains two kinds of functions: circuit functions and application functions.

- **Circuit functions** provide a simplified interface for running circuits. They receive user-provided abstract circuits and observables as input, then manage synthesis, optimization, and execution of the representative ISA circuit. Circuit functions bring together the latest capabilities in transpilation, error suppression, and error mitigation to make utility-grade performance accessible out of the box. This allows computational scientists to focus on mapping their problems to circuits, rather than building the pattern for each problem from scratch.

- **Application functions** cover higher-level tasks, like exploring algorithms and domain-specific use cases. Enterprise developers and data scientists may not have the background quantum information science knowledge for working with circuits, and instead hope to bring their domain knowledge to advance quantum computing algorithms and applications. With application functions, users can enter their classical inputs and receive solutions so they can more easily experiment with plugging quantum into their domain-specific workflows.

With the launch of the Qiskit Functions Catalog, Premium Plan developers will be able to start exploring the IBM Circuit function. The IBM Circuit function includes the latest AI-powered extensions to Qiskit for circuit synthesis, optimization, and scheduling, as well as advanced error mitigation methods to return the most accurate estimations possible with today's hardware.

Users can purchase licenses for the following functions contributed by our partners at Q-CTRL, QEDMA, Algorithmiq, and Qunasys.

### Circuit functions

- Q-CTRL is releasing a circuit function that applies AI-driven quantum control techniques, with which users can scale successfully to larger problems.
- Algorithmiq is releasing a circuit function that applies TEM (tensor-network error mitigation), an error mitigation method for obtaining estimators with fewer shots than the PEC (probabilistic error cancellation) method.
- QEDMA is releasing a circuit function that uses proprietary protocols for efficient and accurate characterization of the noisy QPU operations, and applies error suppression and error mitigation based on the characterization data.

### Application functions

- QunaSys is releasing a chemistry application function comprising three algorithms meant to solve the ground state energy estimation (GSEE) problem.
- Q-CTRL is also releasing an optimization solver with which users can pass a graph or an objective, and receive solution costs.

To get started, explore the [Qiskit Functions documentation](/guides/functions).


## IBM Quantum blog: Two new blogs in January

*Browse all blogs at the [IBM Quantum blog page](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog).*

{/* Bring over the Quantum news (blog) announcement post */}

The first IBM Quantum blog post of the year takes a look back at some of the amazing tools released in 2024 that help make quantum software development easier and more accessible than ever before.
The blog provides recaps of major releases from last year, including Qiskit v1.x, Qiskit addons, Qiskit Transpiler Service, and more - all with code examples and documentation links to help readers get started using them.

*Blog: [A year of simplifying quantum software development tools with Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/dev-tools)*

Next, read how dynamic circuits can enable remarkably efficient long-range entanglement between qubits in a quantum chip. The method was first demonstrated by IBM researchers via a recent paper published in PRX Quantum, and the researchers behind it say their technique could greatly enhance the level of complexity we can represent in quantum circuits through qubit entanglement. The blog explores the power of dynamic circuits and explains how the new method differs from traditional approaches for establishing entanglement between qubits that are not directly connected to each other.
