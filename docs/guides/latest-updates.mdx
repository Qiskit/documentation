## Latest release summaries

{/* release summaries written by product owners */}

### Qiskit SDK v1.2.0

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit SDK release notes](/api/qiskit/release-notes).*

Qiskit 1.2 (stable release) is now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/1.2.0/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/releases/tag/1.2.0). Thanks to the maintainers and open-source contributors!

- Many of the core structures have been moved to Rust, allowing for significant speedups mostly in the construction, manipulation (including copy and parameter assignment), and synthesis of circuits.
- Better compiler quality due to the addition of unitary peephole optimization (for optimization levels 2 and 3) and improvements in Sabre.
- [`generate_preset_pass_manager`](/api/qiskit/transpiler_preset#generate_preset_pass_manager) importance highlight, which is now importable from the top level.

Important deprecations:
- Primitive V1 reference implementations (like `qiskit.primitives.Estimator`) and tooling are deprecated in favor of [V2 primitives](/api/qiskit/primitives). The primitive V1 base classes remain available.
- [`BackendV1`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.BackendV1) is now deprecated in favor of [`BackendV2`](/api/qiskit/qiskit.providers.BackendV2), including the deprecation of `Qobj`, `assemble`, and other scaffolding related to the old V1.
- Support for Python 3.8 will be dropped in the next release, v1.3. Python 3.9 will then be the new minimal required version.

Remember, because this a minor release, it will not introduce breaking changes for users moving from Qiskit SDK v1.0. Any deprecations announced with this release refer only to things that will now start throwing deprecation warnings. None of these will be removed until the release of Qiskit v2.0, pursuant to Qiskit’s official [deprecation policy](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/DEPRECATION.md#).

For more details, read the post about the release on the [IBM Quantum blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-1-2-release-summary), and explore the [v1.2 release notes](/api/qiskit/release-notes/1.2).

### Qiskit Runtime Client 0.28.0

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit Runtime Client release notes](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes).*

**Highlights from the 0.28.0 (2024-08-15) version release**

#### Removal

- The V1 primitives `SamplerV1` and `EstimatorV1` have been completely removed. Refer to the [migration guide](/migration-guides/v2-primitives) for instructions on migrating to V2 primitives.
- The `service` parameter is now required in `Session.from_id()`.

#### New features

- You can now use the `layer_noise_model` option in `ResilienceOptionsV2` to pass in a noise model. When this field is set, all the mitigation strategies that require noise data skip the noise learning stage, and instead gather the required information from `layer_noise_model`. You can use the [NoiseLearner](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.noise_learner.NoiseLearner) class to learn noise and use it in a subsequent `Estimator` call.

See the full [0.28.0 release notes](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes#0280-2024-08-15).

### Qiskit Transpiler Service Client v0.3.0

We’re pleased to share that the beta release of the Qiskit Transpiler Service is now available to all IBM Quantum&trade; Premium Plan users.

The Qiskit Transpiler Service leverages the resources of IBM Cloud&reg; to provide users with the latest transpilation capabilities from the Qiskit SDK. It offers a Python library that helps users seamlessly integrate the service into their current Qiskit patterns and workflows. Perhaps most importantly, the service invites users to experiment with new and improved AI-powered transpiler passes — cutting-edge tools that might be faster and produce better results than traditional transpilation methods.

On the IBM Quantum blog, we take a deep dive into the new beta release with a special focus on the new AI-powered passes. The blog includes detailed explanations showing how to use the Qiskit Transpiler Service for both full circuit transpilation and standalone AI-powered passes, with code examples for each. [Take a look.](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/ai-transpiler-passes)

## Qiskit Runtime service updates

This summary of the latest changes to the Qiskit Runtime service applies to anyone using Qiskit Runtime, regardless of how you communicate with the service (using qiskit-ibm-runtime or otherwise), or which version of the client SDK you use.

### 15 August 2024

- Probabilistic error amplification (PEA) error mitigation method is now available for Estimator V2. See the [`ZneOptions` API reference](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.ZneOptions) for more details.
- A new helper program `noise-learner` is now available. It allows characterizing the noise processes affecting the gates in one or more circuits of interest, based on the Pauli-Lindblad noise model. The output noise model can then be passed to Estimator via the `layer_noise_model` option.
- V1 primitives are no longer supported.

### 3 July 2024

The following endpoints are deprecated and will be removed on or after 3 October 2024: [`GET /stream/jobs`](/api/runtime/tags/jobs#tags__jobs__operations__get_stream_jobs_state_updates) and [`GET /stream/jobs/{id}`](/api/runtime/tags/jobs#tags__jobs__operations__get_stream_job_logs_jid). This removal has the following impacts:

- After the endpoints are removed, `job.stream_results()` and `job.interim_results()` will be removed from the [qiskit-ibm-runtime](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime) client.
- Additional methods, such as `job.result()` currently use the deprecated endpoints.  Upgrade to `qiskit_ibm_runtime` 0.25 or later before the endpoints are removed to avoid disruption.

### 18 June 2024

The `optimization_level` option is deprecated for Estimator V2 and will be removed no sooner than 30 September 2024.

### 3 June 2024

Probabilistic error amplification (PEA) error mitigation method is now available as an experimental option for Estimator V2. See the [`EstimatorOptions` API reference](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.options.EstimatorOptions) for more details.

### 28 March 2024

Qiskit Runtime primitives now support OpenQASM 3 as the input format for circuits and standard JSON output format. See [Qiskit Runtime REST API](/api/runtime) for examples.

## IBM Quantum blog: Qiskit Serverless sets the stage for Qiskit Functions in the cloud

*Browse all blogs at the [IBM Quantum blog page](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog).*

{/* Bring over the Quantum news (blog) announcement post */}

[This week on the IBM Quantum blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-serverless), we're taking a fresh look at Qiskit Serverless, a programming model that empowers users to leverage both quantum and classical resources in a cloud environment. We've made a number of improvements to Qiskit Serverless since its debut at IBM Quantum Summit 2023, and have recently expanded and updated the [Qiskit Serverless documentation](/guides/serverless) to simplify the process of getting started with it.

Qiskit Serverless is a useful tool for performing complex, long-running tasks, and for running workflows that are intended to be executed on a regular basis. You can scale quantum jobs by running them across multiple quantum and classical compute resources, meaning you can continue to efficiently execute your workflows even after you’ve hit the resource limits of the local machine you use for quantum experiments.

In the blog, we take a closer look at how users can take advantage of these capabilities, explain how Qiskit Serverless actually works, and give readers an inside look at the improvements we’ve been making to it over the past several months.
