## IBM Quantum Platform

This section summarizes the recent enhancements and new features for IBM Quantum Platform.

**27 March 2025**

Cost limits for Standard Plan
  
  - Standard Plan users with sufficient access can now view and edit maximum cost limits for their instances. Refer to the [documentation](/guides/upgrade-from-open#set-the-maximum-cost-limit) for more information.

Job management updates

  - Now only administrators can delete workloads created by other users in an account, and collaborators will only be able to delete their own workloads.

Updated authentication error messages

  - We have improved error messaging for account and authentication processes to reduce issues with signup flow. We have also updated our [Support page](/support) with expanded recommendations for troubleshooting and resolving common errors.

For full details on the early access release and upcoming improvements, [check out the blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/iqp-upgrade).

## Qiskit SDK v1.4.0

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit SDK release notes](/api/qiskit/release-notes).*

**21 Feb 2025**

- The latest Qiskit version, 1.4.0, has been released on GitHub and is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/). Even if you recently upgraded to v1.3.3, you should still upgrade to Qiskit 1.4, because this is the last minor version of the v1.x series, and contains all of the deprecation warnings for API changes in Qiskit v2.0. Install it now, and see what to change to be ready for 2.0!

Wondering what will change? Read the [release changelog](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/releases/tag/1.4.0) and the [release notes](/api/qiskit/release-notes/1.4).

## Qiskit Runtime client Qiskit Runtime client 0.37.0

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit Runtime client release notes](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes).*

**13 March 2025**

Deprecation

  - The `IBMBackend` attributes `max_shots` and `max_experiments`, as well as the property `max_circuits`, have all been deprecated. These attribute values used to represent the maximum number of shots and circuits that could be submitted in one job. See [job limits](/guides/job-limits#job-limits) for details.

New features

  - `qiskit-ibm-runtime` is now compatible with Qiskit v2.0. This means that classes and methods removed in Qiskit v2.0 have also been removed or handled accordingly.  The `pulse`- and `channel`-related changes are highlighted in the following list. See the [Pulse migration guide](/migration-guides/pulse-migration) for details.

    - `Channel` methods in `IBMBackend` have been removed.
    - The backend configuration class `PulseBackendConfiguration` has been removed, so all backends will now be returned as `QasmBackendConfiguration`.
    - `PulseDefaults` (backend defaults) can still be retrieved but they are no longer necessary when creating a backend `Target`.

See the full [0.37.0 release notes](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes#0370-2025-03-13).
{/* use url format /api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes#0XYZ to link to the specific 0.XY.Z version of the release notes */}

## Qiskit Runtime service

This summary of the latest changes to the Qiskit Runtime service applies to anyone using Qiskit Runtime, regardless of how you communicate with the service (using qiskit-ibm-runtime or otherwise), or which version of the client SDK you use.

**3 February 2025**

- Pulse-level control on all IBM Quantum processors has been removed.  Additionally, the pulse module is scheduled for removal in Qiskit SDK v2.0.  Instead, you can use fractional gates that are now built into the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). For full details and help migrating your code, refer to [Migrate from Qiskit Pulse to fractional gates.](/migration-guides/pulse-migration)

<summary><b>Previous updates</b></summary>

**2 February 2025**

Starting 2 June 2025 and continuing through the year, IBM Quantum will begin a gradual rollout of new features to [dynamic circuits](/guides/classical-feedforward-and-control-flow) that will enable them at the utility scale.
Improvements include the following:

- A 75x speedup in execution by using the [Gen3 engine stack](/guides/runtime-options-overview#experimental-option-note)
- Parallel execution of branches, which reduces circuit duration and improves result quality
- Improvement in mid-circuit measurement
- Better integration with dynamical decoupling
- More visibility of circuit timing information

To accelerate the rollout, the following capabilities are now deprecated and will be no longer supported on or around 2 June 2025:

- The `while`, `for`, and `switch` control flow constructs
- The ability to use control flow instructions inside the body of a branch (as in, nested control flow)
- Conditional measurements


**7 January 2025**

The rollout of the Gen3 engine stack begins today. This engine stack gives a 75x speedup in execution.  The rollout will be done on one QPU at a time, where a percentage of the jobs on the QPU will use the Gen3 path.  You can also force the Gen3 path using the [`gen3-turbo` experimental option.](/guides/runtime-options-overview#available-options) Note that this engine stack is not compatible with fractional gates, pulse gates, or dynamic circuits.

**15 October 2024**

Support for `backend.run` has ended. See the appropriate [migration guide](/migration-guides/qiskit-runtime) if you have not yet migrated to using primitives.

**1 October 2024**

Parameterized delay gates have been deprecated.

**15 August 2024**

- Probabilistic error amplification (PEA) error mitigation method is now available for Estimator V2. See the [`ZneOptions` API reference](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-zne-options) for more details.
- A new helper program `noise-learner` is now available. It allows characterizing the noise processes affecting the gates in one or more circuits of interest, based on the Pauli-Lindblad noise model. The output noise model can then be passed to Estimator via the `layer_noise_model` option.
- V1 primitives are no longer supported.

**3 July 2024**

The following endpoints are deprecated and will be removed on or after 3 October 2024: [`GET /stream/jobs`](/api/runtime/tags/jobs#tags__jobs__operations__get_stream_jobs_state_updates) and [`GET /stream/jobs/{id}`](/api/runtime/tags/jobs#tags__jobs__operations__get_stream_job_logs_jid). This removal has the following impacts:

- After the endpoints are removed, `job.stream_results()` and `job.interim_results()` will be removed from the [qiskit-ibm-runtime](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime) client.
- Additional methods, such as `job.result()` currently use the deprecated endpoints.  Upgrade to `qiskit_ibm_runtime` 0.25 or later before the endpoints are removed to avoid disruption.

**18 June 2024**

The `optimization_level` option is deprecated for Estimator V2 and will be removed no sooner than 30 September 2024.

**3 June 2024**

Probabilistic error amplification (PEA) error mitigation method is now available as an experimental option for Estimator V2. See the [`EstimatorOptions` API reference](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-estimator-options) for more details.

**28 March 2024**

Qiskit Runtime primitives now support OpenQASM 3 as the input format for circuits and standard JSON output format. See [Qiskit Runtime REST API](/api/runtime) for examples.

## Qiskit Transpiler Service client v0.11.0

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit Transpiler Service client release notes](/api/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/release-notes).*

The Qiskit Transpiler Service leverages the resources of IBM Cloud&reg; to provide users with the latest transpilation capabilities from the Qiskit SDK. It offers a Python library that helps users seamlessly integrate the service into their current Qiskit patterns and workflows. Perhaps most importantly, the service invites users to experiment with new and improved AI-powered transpiler passes â€” cutting-edge tools that might be faster and produce better results than traditional transpilation methods.

**25 March 2025**

- See the [v0.11.0 release notes](/api/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/release-notes#0110-2025-03-25).
