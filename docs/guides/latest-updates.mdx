![Only the latest workloads now shown by default](/docs/images/guides/latest-updates/workloads.avif)

- A new qiskit-ibm-runtime release, featuring:
  - Support for private jobs for developers of Qiskit Functions
  - A new channel for the platform that makes instance selection optional, which simplifies account setup and backend access by automatically checking all available instances. This update benefits users who manage multiple instances or prefer a streamlined workflow without specifying instance details each time. Developers and researchers working across various projects with different levels of access and multiple backends will find this especially helpful.

  See the [Runtime Client v0.40.0](#latest-qiskit-runtime) section for more information. {/* When next Runtime release overwrites the .40 section below, remove this link and replace with direct link to release notes */}

<span id="latest-qiskit-sdk"></span>
## Qiskit SDK v2.2

**October 2025**

Qiskit v2.2 adds several enhancements for the C API and the transpiler, as well as many other improvements and bug fixes. The major features of this new release are:

-  **C API transpile function:** The C API now includes a function for transpiling a quantum circuit: [`qk_transpile()`](/docs/api/qiskit-c/qk-transpiler). This function is equivalent to the Python [`transpile()`](/docs/api/qiskit/compiler#qiskit.compiler.transpile "qiskit.compiler.transpile") function for a standalone C context.
- **Litinski transformation pass:** A new transformation pass [`LitinskiTransformation`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.LitinskiTransformation "qiskit.transpiler.passes.LitinskiTransformation") that implements the transform described [arXiv:1808.02892](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02892). This pass is typically used in compilation for fault-tolerant architectures.
- **Angle bound support for targets:** The [`Target`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.Target "qiskit.transpiler.Target") class now supports specifying bounds for the allowed values for parameterized operations added to the target. When an instruction is added to the [`Target`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.Target "qiskit.transpiler.Target"), you can add the optional argument `angle_bounds` to specify the higher and lower bounds for parameterized rotation gates. A new transpiler pass [`WrapAngles`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.passes.WrapAngles "qiskit.transpiler.passes.WrapAngles") was also added to enforce the angle constraints as part of a transpilation pipeline.

Wondering what has changed? Read the [changelog](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/releases/tag/2.2.0) and the [v2.2 release notes.](/docs/api/qiskit/release-notes/2.2)

{/* use url format /api/qiskit/release-notes/X.X to link to the specific X.X version of the release notes */}

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit SDK release notes](/docs/api/qiskit/release-notes).*


<span id="latest-qiskit-runtime"></span>
## Qiskit Runtime client 0.42.0

**September 2025**

- Highlights: Since backends now support running jobs that contain both fractional gates and dynamic circuits, control flow instructions are no longer filtered out when using `use_fractional_gates=True`. As a result, there is a new translation state plugin, `IBMDynamicFractionalTranslationPlugin`, for targeting circuits with both dynamic circuits and fractional gates.

- For all updates, bug fixes, and new features, see the full [0.42.0 release notes.](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes#0420-2025-09-15)

{/* use url format /api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes#0XYZ to link to the specific 0.XY.Z version of the release notes */}

<span id="latest-runtime-service"></span>
## Qiskit Runtime service

This summary of the latest changes to the Qiskit Runtime service applies to anyone using Qiskit Runtime, regardless of how you communicate with the service (by using `qiskit-ibm-runtime` or otherwise), or which version of the client SDK you use.

**October 2025**

- The new dynamic circuits is now available to all users on all backends, except some QPUs under the On-Prem Plan.

  With this new version, you can run dynamic circuits at utility scale. The initial release offers the following features:

  - 75x execution speedup, thanks to the latest quantum execution stack
  - Parallel branch execution, which reduces circuit duration and improves result quality
  - Support for [classical operations](/docs/api/qiskit/circuit_classical) defined in Qiskit, with the exception of bit shift and arithmetic
  - Support for stretch duration in delay instructions. This new type allows design intent to be captured at circuit construction time, and timing resolution at compile time

  Additional features will be rolled out later this year.

  See  [Classical feedforward and control flow](/docs/guides/classical-feedforward-and-control-flow) and [Deferred timing resolution using stretch](/docs/guides/stretch) for more information and code examples.

<details>
<summary><b>Previous updates</b></summary>

**5 June 2025**

- Now available: Early access to the new version of dynamic circuits on select QPUs. This new version will allow you to run dynamic circuits at utility scale and comes with improvements in speed, quality, and usability. Premium Plan and Flex Plan users interested in participating in this early access can [contact us.](/docs/support)

**3 February 2025**

- Pulse-level control on all IBM Quantum processors has been removed.  Additionally, the pulse module is scheduled for removal in Qiskit SDK v2.0.  Instead, you can use fractional gates that are now built into the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). For full details and help migrating your code, refer to [Migrate from Qiskit Pulse to fractional gates.](/docs/migration-guides/pulse-migration)

**2 February 2025**

- Starting 2 June 2025 and continuing through the year, IBM Quantum will begin a gradual rollout of new features to [dynamic circuits](/docs/guides/classical-feedforward-and-control-flow) that will enable them at the utility scale.
Improvements include the following:

  - A 75x speedup in execution by using the Gen3 engine stack
  - Parallel execution of branches, which reduces circuit duration and improves result quality
  - Improvement in mid-circuit measurement
  - Better integration with dynamical decoupling
  - More visibility of circuit timing information

- To accelerate the rollout, the following capabilities are now deprecated and will be no longer supported on or around 2 June 2025:

  - The `while`, `for`, and `switch` control flow constructs
  - The ability to use control flow instructions inside the body of a branch (as in, nested control flow)
  - Conditional measurements

**7 January 2025**

- The rollout of the Gen3 engine stack begins today. This engine stack gives a 75x speedup in execution.  The rollout will be done on one QPU at a time, where a percentage of the jobs on the QPU will use the Gen3 path.  You can also force the Gen3 path using the `gen3-turbo` experimental option. Note that this engine stack is not compatible with fractional gates, pulse gates, or dynamic circuits.

**15 October 2024**

  - Support for `backend.run` has ended.

**1 October 2024**

  - Parameterized delay gates have been deprecated.

**15 August 2024**

  - Probabilistic error amplification (PEA) error mitigation method is now available for Estimator V2. See the [`ZneOptions` API reference](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-zne-options) for more details.
  - A new helper program `noise-learner` is now available. It allows characterizing the noise processes affecting the gates in one or more circuits of interest, based on the Pauli-Lindblad noise model. The output noise model can then be passed to Estimator via the `layer_noise_model` option.
  - V1 primitives are no longer supported.

**3 July 2024**

  - The following endpoints are deprecated and will be removed on or after 3 October 2024: [`GET /stream/jobs`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/tags/jobs#tags__jobs__operations__get_stream_jobs_state_updates) and [`GET /stream/jobs/{id}`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/tags/jobs#tags__jobs__operations__get_stream_job_logs_jid). This removal has the following impacts:

    - After the endpoints are removed, `job.stream_results()` and `job.interim_results()` will be removed from the [qiskit-ibm-runtime](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime) client.
    - Additional methods, such as `job.result()` currently use the deprecated endpoints.  Upgrade to `qiskit_ibm_runtime` 0.25 or later before the endpoints are removed to avoid disruption.

**18 June 2024**

  - The `optimization_level` option is deprecated for Estimator V2 and will be removed no sooner than 30 September 2024.

**3 June 2024**

  - Probabilistic error amplification (PEA) error mitigation method is now available as an experimental option for Estimator V2. See the [`EstimatorOptions` API reference](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-estimator-options) for more details.

**28 March 2024**

  - Qiskit Runtime primitives now support OpenQASM 3 as the input format for circuits and standard JSON output format. See [Qiskit Runtime REST API](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime) for examples.
</details>

<span id="latest-qiskit-transpiler-service"></span>
## Qiskit Transpiler Service client v0.11.0

**25 March 2025**

- See the [v0.11.0 release notes.](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/release-notes#0110-2025-03-25)

*To see the release notes for all versions, visit the [Qiskit Transpiler Service client release notes](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-transpiler/release-notes).*

<details>
<summary><b>Previous updates</b></summary>

- Qiskit Transpiler Service client v0.3.0

  - The Qiskit Transpiler Service leverages IBM Cloud&reg; resources to provide users with the latest transpilation capabilities from the Qiskit SDK. It offers a Python library that helps users seamlessly integrate the service into their current Qiskit patterns and workflows. Perhaps most importantly, the service invites users to experiment with new and improved AI-powered transpiler passes — cutting-edge tools that might be faster and produce better results than traditional transpilation methods. Read the [blog](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/ai-transpiler-passes) for more information.
</details>

<span id="latest-qiskit-serverless"></span>
## Qiskit Serverless

**16 May 2025**

- [Developers can set detailed statuses and track what's happening across a workflow.](/docs/guides/serverless-manage-resources#set-detailed-statuses)

  Serverless workloads have several stages across a workflow. By default, the following statuses are viewable with `job.status()`:

  - `QUEUED`: The workload is queued for classical resources.
  - `INITIALIZING`: The workload is set up.
  - `RUNNING`: The workload is currently running on classical resources.
  - `DONE`: The workload has successfully completed.

  Now, you can also set custom statuses that further describe the specific workflow stage, as in the following example.

    <details>
  <summary>Expand for code example</summary>

    ```python
    from qiskit_serverless import update_status, Job
    
    ## If your function has a mapping stage, particularly application functions, you can set the status to "RUNNING: MAPPING" as follows:
    update_status(Job.MAPPING)
    
    ## While handling transpilation, error suppression, and so forth, you can set the status to "RUNNING: OPTIMIZING_FOR_HARDWARE":
    update_status(Job.OPTIMIZING_HARDWARE)
    
    ## After you submit jobs to Qiskit Runtime, the underlying quantum job will be queued. You can set status to "RUNNING: WAITING_FOR_QPU":
    update_status(Job.WAITING_QPU)
    
    ## When the Qiskit Runtime job starts running on the QPU, set the following status "RUNNING: EXECUTING_QPU":
    update_status(Job.EXECUTING_QPU)
    
    ## After the QPU is completed and post-processing has begun, set the status "RUNNING: POST_PROCESSING":
    update_status(Job.POST_PROCESSING)
    ```
  </details>

<span id="latest-qiskit-functions"></span>
## Qiskit Functions

**5 June 2025**

- We're excited to roll out two new functions for finance and optimization:
  - [QUICK-PDE](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/functions?id=colibritd-quick-pde) by ColibriTD allows users to solve certain differential equations for material deformation and computational fluid dynamics problems. For example, one team of researchers has already begun using the QUICK-PDE function to study the dynamics of novel reactive fluids developed to transfer heat more efficiently in a type of nuclear reactor known as Small Modular Reactors.

  - [Quantum Portfolio Optimizer](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/functions?id=global-data-quantum-quantum-portfolio-optimizer) by Global Data Quantum enables quantitative finance researchers to back-test portfolio optimization strategies. Running on over 100 qubits, this function calculates a portfolio’s Sharpe ratio versus return across a specified time period. Early users are exploring the optimizer’s ability to evaluate historical performance of an investment strategy and to enable comparisons of different portfolios under similar conditions.

Check out the [Qiskit Functions Catalog](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/functions) to request a free trial today.

**4 June 2025**

- New updates

  - Documentation for Singularity Machine Learning - Classification has been updated. View the [Changelog](/docs/guides/multiverse-computing-singularity#changelog).

<details>
<summary><b>Previous updates</b></summary>

**16 May 2025**

- Over the coming weeks, every function will give detailed information to help you run, debug, and analyze your workflows. This includes:

  - When jobs fail, you can use `job.error_message()` to find specific error codes and messages to help you debug your workflows
  - `job.status()` will give more information on what's happening while a Function is `RUNNING`, including:
    - `RUNNING: MAPPING`
    - `RUNNING: OPTIMIZING_FOR_HARDWARE`
    - `RUNNING: WAITING_FOR_QPU`
    - `RUNNING: EXECUTING_QPU`
    - `RUNNING: POST_PROCESSING`
  - Finally, after a Qiskit Function is complete, you can inspect how much time is spent across each stage with `job.result()['metadata']['resource_usage']`, as in the following example.

  <details>
  <summary>Expand for code example</summary>
  ```json
  {
        ...,
    "metadata": {
      "resource_usage": {
        {

            "QPU_TIME": seconds,
          }, 
          "RUNNING: OPTIMIZING_FOR_HARDWARE": {
            "CPU_TIME": seconds,
            "GPU_TIME": seconds,
            "QPU_TIME": seconds,
          }, 
          "RUNNING: WAITING_FOR_QPU": {
            "CPU_TIME": seconds,
            "GPU_TIME": seconds,
            "QPU_TIME": seconds,
          }, 
          "RUNNING: EXECUTING_QPU": {
            "CPU_TIME": seconds,
            "GPU_TIME": seconds,
            "QPU_TIME": seconds,
          }, 
          "RUNNING: POST_PROCESSING": {
            "CPU_TIME": seconds,
            "GPU_TIME": seconds,
            "QPU_TIME": seconds,
          }, 
        }, 
      }
    }
  }
  ```

To get started, explore the [Qiskit Functions documentation.](/docs/guides/functions)

**16 September 2024**

- Introducing the Qiskit Functions preview, for IBM Quantum Premium Plan users. To get started, `pip install qiskit-ibm-catalog` and explore the [Qiskit Functions documentation.](/docs/guides/functions) With the Qiskit Functions Catalog client, you can submit workloads to abstracted services designed to accelerate your research. Sign in with your existing IBM Quantum Platform credentials.

  The Qiskit Functions Catalog preview provides access to Premium Plan users to explore the available functions, including those written by IBM and those written by other members of our ecosystem. The catalog contains two kinds of functions: circuit functions and application functions.

    - **Circuit functions** provide a simplified interface for running circuits. They receive user-provided abstract circuits and observables as input, then manage synthesis, optimization, and execution of the representative ISA circuit. Circuit functions bring together the latest capabilities in transpilation, error suppression, and error mitigation to make utility-grade performance accessible out of the box. This allows computational scientists to focus on mapping their problems to circuits, rather than building the pattern for each problem from scratch.

    - **Application functions** cover higher-level tasks, like exploring algorithms and domain-specific use cases. Enterprise developers and data scientists may not have the background quantum information science knowledge for working with circuits, and instead hope to bring their domain knowledge to advance quantum computing algorithms and applications. With application functions, users can enter their classical inputs and receive solutions so they can more easily experiment with plugging quantum into their domain-specific workflows.

- With the launch of the Qiskit Functions Catalog, Premium Plan developers can explore the IBM Circuit function. The IBM Circuit function includes the latest AI-powered extensions to Qiskit for circuit synthesis, optimization, and scheduling, as well as advanced error mitigation methods to return the most accurate estimations possible with today's hardware.

  Users can purchase licenses for the following functions contributed by our partners at Q-CTRL, QEDMA, and Algorithmiq.

- **Circuit functions**

  - Q-CTRL is releasing a circuit function that applies AI-driven quantum control techniques, with which users can scale successfully to larger problems.
  - Algorithmiq is releasing a circuit function that applies TEM (tensor-network error mitigation), an error mitigation method for obtaining estimators with fewer shots than the PEC (probabilistic error cancellation) method.
  - QEDMA is releasing a circuit function that uses proprietary protocols for efficient and accurate characterization of the noisy QPU operations, and applies error suppression and error mitigation based on the characterization data.

- **Application functions**

  - Q-CTRL is releasing an optimization solver with which users can pass a graph or an objective, and receive solution costs.
