    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "While quantum processing units have vastly improved in recent years, errors due to noise and imperfections in existing hardware remain a central challenge for quantum algorithm developers. As the field approaches utility-scale quantum computations that cannot be verified classically, solutions for canceling noise with guaranteed accuracy are becoming increasingly important. To overcome this challenge, Qedma has developed Quantum Error Suppression and Error Mitigation (QESEM), seamlessly integrated on IBM Quantum Platform as a [Qiskit Function](/guides/functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "With QESEM, users can run their quantum circuits on noisy QPUs to obtain highly accurate error-free results with highly efficient QPU-time overheads, close to fundamental bounds. To achieve this, QESEM leverages a suite of propriety methods developed by Qedma, for the characterization and reduction of errors. Error reduction techniques include gate optimization, noise-aware transpilation, error suppression (ES), and unbiased error mitigation (EM). With this combination of these characterization-based methods, users can achieve reliable, error-free results for generic large-volume quantum circuits, unlocking applications that cannot be accomplished otherwise."

    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the QESEM function by Qedma to easily estimate and execute your circuits with error suppression and mitigation, achieving larger circuit volumes and higher accuracies. To use QESEM, you provide a quantum circuit, a set of observables to measure, a target statistical accuracy for each observable, and a chosen QPU. Before you run the circuit to the target accuracy, you can estimate the required QPU time based on an analytical calculation that does not require circuit execution. Once you are satisfied with the QPU time estimation, you can execute the circuit with QESEM.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute a circuit, QESEM runs a device characterization protocol tailored to your circuit, yielding a reliable noise model for the errors occurring in the circuit. Based on the characterization, QESEM first implements noise-aware transpilation to map the input circuit onto a set of physical qubits and gates, which minimizes the noise affecting the target observable. These include the natively available gates (CX/CZ on IBM&reg; devices), as well as additional gates optimized by QESEM, forming QESEM’s extended gate set. QESEM then runs a set of characterization-based ES and EM circuits on the QPU and collects their measurement outcomes. These are then classically post-processed to provide an unbiased expectation value and an error bar for each observable, corresponding to the requested accuracy.\n",

    "QESEM has been demonstrated to provide high-accuracy results for a variety of quantum applications and on the largest circuit volumes achievable today. QESEM offers the following user-facing features, demonstrated in the benchmarks section below:\n",
    "-\t**Guaranteed accuracy:** QESEM outputs unbiased estimations for expectation values of observables. Its EM method is equipped with theoretical guarantees, which - together with Qedma’s cutting-edge characterization - ensure the mitigation converges to the noiseless circuit output up to the user-specified accuracy. In contrast to many heuristic EM methods that are prone to systematic errors or biases, QESEM’s guaranteed accuracy is essential for ensuring reliable results in generic quantum circuits and observables.\n",
    "-\t**Scalability to large QPUs:** QESEM’s QPU time depends on circuit volumes, but is otherwise independent of the number of qubits. Qedma has demonstrated QESEM on the largest quantum devices available today, including the IBM Quantum 127-qubit Eagle and 133-qubit Heron devices.\n",
    "-\t**Application-agnostic:** QESEM has been demonstrated on a variety of applications, including Hamiltonian simulation, VQE, QAOA, and amplitude estimation. Users can input any quantum circuit and observable to be measured, and obtain accurate error-free results. The only limitations are dictated by the hardware specifications and allocated QPU time, which determine the accessible circuit volumes and output accuracies. In contrast, many error reduction solutions are application-specific or involve uncontrolled heuristics, rendering them inapplicable for generic quantum circuits and applications.\n",
    "-  **Extended gate set:** QESEM supports fractional-angle gates, and provides Qedma-optimized fractional-angle $Rzz(\\theta)$ gates on IBM Quantum Eagle devices. This extended gate set enables more efficient compilation and unlocks circuit volumes larger by a factor of up to 2 compared to default CX/CZ compilation.\n",
    "-\t**Multibase observables:** QESEM supports input observables composed of many non-commuting Pauli strings, such as generic Hamiltonians. The choice of measurement bases and the optimization of QPU resource allocation (shots and circuits) is then performed automatically by QESEM to minimize the required QPU time for the requested accuracy. This optimization, which takes into account hardware fidelities and execution rates, enables you to run deeper circuits and obtain higher accuracies."

For further details, see the talk from the [2024 IBM Quantum Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd-IGvuARfE&t=1730s).

The utility-scale circuit was run on the 119 best qubits of ibm_brisbane, whereas the 40-qubit experiment was run on the best available chain. The accuracy is reported for the magnetization; high-accuracy results were obtained for higher-weight observables as well.\n",

The target observable here was a Hamiltonian consisting of a large number of non-commuting Pauli strings, emphasizing QESEM's optimized performance for multi-basis observables. Mitigation was applied to a classically-optimized ansatz; although these results are still unpublished, results of the same quality will be obtained for different circuits with similar structural properties."

If the dynamically-determined QPU time is shorter than the time allocated by the user, this parameter will not affect the experiment. The `max_execution_time` parameter is particularly useful in cases where the analytical time estimate provided by QESEM before the job starts is too pessimistic and the user wants to initiate a mitigation job anyway. After the time limit it reached, QESEM stops sending new circuits. Circuits that have already been sent continue running (so the total time may surpass the limit by up to 30 minutes), and the user receives the processed results from the circuits that ran up to that point.

While `\"transpilation_level\": 1` corresponds to the default behavior described above, `\"transpilation_level\": 0` includes only minimal modifications required to the original circuit; for example, ‘layerification’ - the organization of circuit operations into ‘layers’ of simultaneous two-qubit gates.
