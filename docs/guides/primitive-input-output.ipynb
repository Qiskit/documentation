    "This page gives an overview of the inputs and outputs of the Qiskit Runtime primitives that execute workloads on IBM Quantum&reg; compute resources. These primitives provide you with the ability to efficiently define vectorized workloads by using a data structure known as a **Primitive Unified Bloc (PUB)**. These PUBs are the fundamental unit of work a QPU needs to execute these workloads. They are used as inputs to the [`run()`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/estimator-v2#run) method for the Sampler and Estimator primitives, which execute the defined workload as a job. Then, after the job has completed, the results are returned in a format that is dependent on both the PUBs used as well as the runtime options specified from the Sampler or Estimator primitives."

    "When invoking a primitive's [`run()`](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/estimator-v2#run) method, the main argument that is required is a `list` of one or more tuples -- one for each circuit being executed by the primitive. Each of these tuples is considered a PUB, and the required elements of each tuple in the list depends on the primitive used. The data provided to these tuples can also be arranged in a variety of shapes to provide flexibility in a workload through broadcasting -- the rules of which are described in a [following section](#broadcasting-rules).\n",

    "- A single `QuantumCircuit`, which may contain one or more [`Parameter`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.Parameter) objects\n",
    "- A list of one or more observables, which specify the expectation values to estimate, arranged into an array (for example, a single observable represented as a 0-d array, a list of observables as a 1-d array, and so on). The data can be in any one of the `ObservablesArrayLike` format such as `Pauli`, `SparsePauliOp`, `PauliList`, or `str`.\n",
    "   <Admonition type=\"note\">\n",
    "   If you have two commuting observables in different PUBs but with the same circuit, they will not be estimated using the same measurement. Each PUB represents a different basis for measurement, and therefore, separate measurements are required for each PUB. To ensure that commuting observables are estimated using the same measurement, they must be grouped within the same PUB.\n",
    "   </Admonition>\n",
    "- A collection of parameter values to bind the circuit against. This can be specified as a single array-like object where the last index is over circuit `Parameter` objects, or omitted (or equivalently, set to `None`) if the circuit has no `Parameter` objects.\n",

The `PrimitiveResult` contains an iterable list of [`PubResult`](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.PubResult) objects that contain the execution results for each PUB.

    "#### How the Estimator calculates error\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the estimate of the mean of the observables passed in the input PUBs (the `evs` field of the `DataBin`), the Estimator also attempts to deliver an estimate of the error associated with those expectation values. All estimator queries will populate the `stds` field with a quantity like the standard error of the mean for each expectation value, but some error mitigation options produce additional information, such as `ensemble_standard_error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a single observable $\\mathcal{O}$. In the absence of [ZNE](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#zero-noise-extrapolation-zne), you can think of each shot of the Estimator execution as providing a point estimate of the expectation value $\\langle \\mathcal{O} \\rangle$. If the pointwise estimates are in a vector `Os`, then the value returned in `ensemble_standard_error` is equivalent to the following (in which $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{O}}$ is the [standard deviation of the expectation value](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.primitives.BackendEstimatorV2) estimate and $N_{shots}$ is the number of shots):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{ \\sigma_{\\mathcal{O}} }{ \\sqrt{N_{shots}} },$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which treats all shots as part of a single ensemble. If you requested gate [twirling](/docs/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#pauli-twirling) (`twirling.enable_gates = True`), you can sort the pointwise estimates of $\\langle \\mathcal{O} \\rangle$ into sets that share a common twirl. Call these sets of estimates `O_twirls`, and there are `num_randomizations` (number of twirls) of them. Then `stds` is the standard error of the mean of `O_twirls`, as in\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{ \\sigma_{\\mathcal{O}} }{ \\sqrt{N_{twirls}} },$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{O}}$ is the standard deviation of `O_twirls` and $N_{twirls}$ is the number of twirls. When you do not enable twirling, `stds` and `ensemble_standard_error` are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you enable ZNE, then the `stds` described above become weights in a non-linear regression to an extrapolator model. What finally gets returned in the `stds` in this case is the uncertainty of the fit model evaluated at a noise factor of zero. When there is a poor fit, or large uncertainty in the fit, the reported `stds` can become very large. When ZNE is enabled, `pub_result.data.evs_noise_factors` and `pub_result.data.stds_noise_factors` are also populated, so that you can do your own extrapolation."
