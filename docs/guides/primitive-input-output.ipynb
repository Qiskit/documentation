    "This page gives an overview of the inputs and outputs of the Qiskit Runtime primitives that execute workloads on IBM Quantum&trade; compute resources. These primitives provide you with the ability to efficiently define vectorized workloads by using a data structure known as a **Primitive Unified Bloc (PUB)**. These PUBs are the fundamental unit of work a QPU needs to execute these workloads. They are used as inputs to the [`run()`](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/estimator-v-2#run) method for the Sampler and Estimator primitives, which execute the defined workload as a job. Then, after the job has completed, the results are returned in a format that is dependent on both the PUBs used as well as the runtime options specified from the Sampler or Estimator primitives."

    "Parameter value sets are represented by n x m arrays, and observable arrays are represented by one or more single-column arrays. For each example in the previous code, the parameter value sets are combined with their observable array to create the resulting expectation value estimates.  Example 1 (broadcast single observable) has a parameter value set that is a 5x1 array and a 1x1 observables array.  The one item in the observables array is combined with each item in the parameter value set to create a single 5x1 array where each item is a combination of the original item in the parameter value set with the item in the observables array.  Example 2 (zip) has a 5x1 parameter value set and a 5x1 observables array.  The output is a 5x1 array where each item is a combination of the nth item in the parameter value set with the nth item in the observables array.  Example 3 (outer/product) has a 1x6 parameter value set and a 4x1 observables array.  Their combination results in a 4x6 array that is created by combining each item in the parameter value set with *every* item in the observables array, and thus each parameter value becomes an entire column in the output.  Example 4 (Standard nd generalization) has a 3x6 parameter value set array and two 3x1 observables array.  These combine to create two 3x6 output arrays in a similar manner to the previous example.\n",

    "#### How the Estimator calculates error\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the estimate of the mean of the observables passed in the input PUBs (the `evs` field of the `DataBin`), the Estimator also attempts to deliver an estimate of the error associated with those expectation values. All estimator queries will populate the `stds` field with a quantity like the standard error of the mean for each expectation value, but some error mitigation options produce additional information, such as `ensemble_standard_error`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a single observable $\\mathcal{O}$. In the absence of [ZNE](/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#zero-noise-extrapolation-zne), you can think of each shot of the Estimator execution as providing a point estimate of the expectation value $\\langle \\mathcal{O} \\rangle$. If the pointwise estimates are in a vector `Os`, then the value returned in `ensemble_standard_error` is equivalent to the following (in which $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{O}}$ is the standard deviation of the expectation value estimate and $N_{shots}$ is the number of shots):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{ \\sigma_{\\mathcal{O}} }{ \\sqrt{N_{shots}} },$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which treats all shots as part of a single ensemble. If you requested gate [twirling](/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#pauli-twirling) (`twirling.enable_gates = True`), you can sort the pointwise estimates of $\\langle \\mathcal{O} \\rangle$ into sets that share a common twirl. Call these sets of estimates `O_twirls`, and there are `num_randomizations` (number of twirls) of them. Then `stds` is the standard error of the mean of `O_twirls`, as in\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{ \\sigma_{\\mathcal{O}} }{ \\sqrt{N_{twirls}} },$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma_{\\mathcal{O}}$ is the standard deviation of `O_twirls` and $N_{twirls}$ is the number of twirls. When you do not enable twirling, `stds` and `ensemble_standard_error` are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you enable ZNE, then the `stds` described above become weights in a non-linear regression to an extrapolator model. What finally gets returned in the `stds` in this case is the uncertainty of the fit model evaluated at a noise factor of zero. When there is a poor fit, or large uncertainty in the fit, the reported `stds` can become very large. When ZNE is enabled, `pub_result.data.evs_noise_factors` and `pub_result.data.stds_noise_factors` are also populated, so that you can do your own extrapolation."

The attribute label for each bit array object depends on the `ClassicalRegisters` defined in the circuit being executed.
