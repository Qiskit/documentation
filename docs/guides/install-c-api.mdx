# Install the Qiskit C API

This guide describes how to install and use the Qiskit C API. To see how to extend your
Qiskit Python workflow with C, read [Extend Python with the Qiskit C API](/docs/guides/c-extension-for-python).

The following example builds an observable with C:
```c
// file: example.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <complex.h>
#include <qiskit.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // build a 100-qubit empty observable
    u_int32_t num_qubits = 100;
    QkObs *obs = qk_obs_zero(num_qubits);

    // add the term 2 * (X0 Y1 Z2) to the observable
    complex double coeff = 2;  // on MSVC use: _Dcomplex coeff = {2, 0}
    QkBitTerm bit_terms[3] = {QkBitTerm_X, QkBitTerm_Y, QkBitTerm_Z};  // bit terms: X Y Z
    uint32_t indices[3] = {0, 1, 2};  // indices: 0 1 2
    QkObsTerm term = {coeff, 3, bit_terms, indices, num_qubits};
    qk_obs_add_term(obs, &term);  // append the term

    // print some properties and the observable itself
    printf("num_qubits: %i\n", qk_obs_num_qubits(obs));
    printf("num_terms: %lu\n", qk_obs_num_terms(obs));
    printf("observable: %s\n", qk_obs_str(obs));

    // free the memory allocated for the observable
    qk_obs_free(obs);

    return 0;
}
```

## UNIX-like

This section provides build instructions for UNIX-like systems.

### Requirements

Compilation requires the following tools:
* A Rust compiler: see for example the [guide on installing Qiskit from source](/docs/guides/install-qiskit-source)
* A C compiler: for example, GCC on Linux and Clang on MacOS. Qiskit's C API is compatible with a compiler conforming to the [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)) standard.
* [`cbindgen`](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen): a tool to create the C header, which you can install with `cargo install cbindgen`
    Note that running the tool from the command line should be enabled, which might require exporting your `PATH` variable to include `/path/to/.cargo/bin`
* (GNU) Make: this is optional but is recommended to use automated install processes

This code verifies that everything has been installed:
```bash
rustc --version
gcc --version
cbindgen --version
make --version  # optional, but recommended
```

### Build

To build the C header and library, you can run the following Make command[^1] in Qiskit root,
[^1]: If you did not install Make, check the `Makefile` in Qiskit root for the required commands - or simply install Make; it's not too late.)
```bash
make c
```
which will provide the compiled shared library in `dist/c/lib` and the `qiskit.h` header with
all function declarations in `dist/c/include`. Note that the precise library name depends
on the platform; for example,`libqiskit.so` on UNIX and `libqiskit.dylib` on MacOS.
(Note that this step currently emits a lot of warnings, which is expected, and is no cause for alarm. Future versions will remove the warnings.)

You can then compile a C program using the Qiskit C header and library:
```bash
gcc example.c -o example.o -I /path/to/dist/c/include -L /path/to/dist/c/lib -lqiskit
```
To ensure the library is found during execution, set the runtime library path to
include `/path/to/dist/c/lib`. This depends on the platform. On Linux:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dist/c/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
On MacOS:
```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dist/c/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
Alternatively, you can set the runtime library path during compilation by adding
```
-Wl,-rpath,/path/to/dist/c/lib
```
to the compiler flags.

Now you can execute the binary:
```bash
./example.o
```
which, if using the example snippet shown previously, should print
```
num_qubits: 100
num_terms: 1
observable: SparseObservable { num_qubits: 100, coeffs: [Complex { re: 2.0, im: 0.0 }], bit_terms: [X, Y, Z], indices: [0, 1, 2], boundaries: [0, 3] }
```

## Windows

This section provides build instructions for Windows systems.

### Requirements

Compilation requires the following tools:
* A Rust compiler: see for example the [guide on installing Qiskit from source](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-qiskit-from-source)
* A C compiler: for example, MSVC and the native command prompt offering the ``cl`` command
* A Python installation, with access to both ``python3.lib`` and ``python3.dll``
* [`cbindgen`](https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen): a tool to create the C header, which you can install with `cargo install cbindgen`
    Note that running the tool from the command line should be enabled, which might require updating your `PATH` variable to include the cargo path.

### Build

First, compile the `qiskit_cext` dynamic library, by running the following in Qiskit root
```bash
set PATH="\path\to\pythonlib";%PATH%
cargo rustc --release --crate-type cdylib -p qiskit-cext
```
This will generate the ``.dll`` dynamic library and associated ``.dll.lib`` file in `target/release`.
Next, generate the header with
```bash
cbindgen --crate qiskit-cext --output dist\c\include\qiskit.h
```
This will write the MSVC-compatible header in ``dist\c\include``.

Now you can use `cl` to compile the C program. To ensure the compiler finds the qiskit library,
we include `target\release` in the `PATH` variable.
```bash
set PATH="\path\to\target\release";%PATH%
cl example.c qiskit_cext.dll.lib -I\path\to\dist\c\include
```

Before running, you have to include the path to your ``python3.dll``.
```bash
set PATH="\path\to\python3-dll";%PATH%
.\example.exe
```
should then print
```
num_qubits: 100
num_terms: 1
observable: SparseObservable { num_qubits: 100, coeffs: [Complex { re: 2.0, im: 0.0 }], bit_terms: [X, Y, Z], indices: [0, 1, 2], boundaries: [0, 3] }
```
