# Run jobs in a batch


<Admonition type="caution" title="Important">
The way batches are started within Qiskit Runtime has changed. **By 1 April 2024**, upgrade to `qiskit-ibm-runtime` version 0.20.0 or later. In addition, ensure you are using Qiskit version 0.45.0 or later. Starting 1 April, batch calls made in earlier versions of these packages will fail.
</Admonition>

Batch mode can shorten processing time if all jobs can be provided at the outset. If you want to submit iterative jobs, use [sessions](sessions) instead.  Using batch mode has these benefits:

-  The jobs' classical computation, such as compilation, is run in parallel. Thus, running multiple jobs in a batch is significantly faster than running them serially.
-  There is usually minimal delay between jobs, which can help avoid drift.
-  If you partition your workload into multiple jobs and run them in batch mode, you can get results from individual jobs, which makes them more flexible to work with.  For example, if a job's results don't meet your expectations, you can cancel the remaining jobs. Also, if one job fails, you can re-submit it instead of re-running the entire workload.

<Admonition type="note">
    When batching, jobs are not guaranteed to run in the order they are submitted. Also, while your batch jobs will run as closely together as possible, they don't get exclusive access to the backend. Therefore, your batch jobs might run in parallel with other users' jobs if there is enough processing capacity on the QPU. Additionally, QPU calibration jobs could run between the batched jobs.

## Open a batch

You can open a runtime batch by using the context manager `with Batch(...)` or by initializing the `Batch`
class. When you start a batch,  you must specify a QPU by passing a `backend` object.  The batch starts when its first job begins execution.


**Batch class**

``` python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Batch, SamplerV2 as Sampler, EstimatorV2 as Estimator

backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)
batch = Batch(backend=backend)
estimator = Estimator(mode=batch)
sampler = Sampler(mode=batch)
batch.close()
```


**Context manager**

The context manager automatically opens and closes the batch.

``` python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Batch, SamplerV2 as Sampler, EstimatorV2 as Estimator

backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)
with Batch(backend=backend):
  estimator = Estimator()
  sampler = Sampler()
```

<span id="specify-batch-length"></span>
## Batch length

You can define the batch's maximum time to live (TTL) with the `max_time` parameter. This should exceed the longest job's execution time and be within the QPU's limits. This timer starts when the batch starts.  When the value is reached, the batch is closed.  Any jobs that are running will finish, but jobs still queued are failed.

``` python
with Batch(backend=backend, max_time="25m"):
  ...
```

There is also an interactive time to live (ITTL) value of 1 second that cannot be configured.  If no batch jobs are queued within that window, the batch is temporarily deactivated.

<span id="close"></span>
## Close a batch

A batch automatically closes when it exits the context manager. When the batch context manager is exited, the batch is put into "In progress, not accepting new jobs" status. This means that the batch finishes processing all running or queued jobs until the maximum TTL value is reached. After all jobs are completed, the batch is immediately closed. You cannot submit jobs to a closed batch.

``` python
with Batch(backend=backend) as batch:
    estimator = Estimator()
    job1 = estimator.run(...)
    job2 = estimator.run(...)

# The batch is no longer accepting jobs but the submitted job will run to completion.
result = job1.result()
result2 = job2.result()
```

If you are not using a context manager, manually close the batch.  If you leave the batch open and submit more jobs to it later, it is possible that the maximum TTL will be reached before the subsequent jobs start running; causing them to be canceled. You can close a batch as soon as you are done submitting jobs to it. When a batch is closed with `batch.close()`, it no longer accepts new jobs, but the already submitted jobs will still run until completion and their results can be retrieved.

``` python
batch = Batch(backend=backend)

# If using qiskit-ibm-runtime earlier than 0.24.0, change `mode=` to `batch=`
estimator = Estimator(mode=batch)
job1 = estimator.run(...)
job2 = estimator.run(...)
print(f"Result1: {job1.result()}")
print(f"Result2: {job2.result()}")

# Manually close the batch. Running and queued jobs will run to completion.
batch.close()
```

## Reconfigure jobs for parallel processing

There are multiple ways you can reconfigure your jobs to take advantage of the parallel processing provided by batching. The following example shows how you can partition a long list of circuits into multiple jobs and run them as a batch to take advantage of the parallel processing.

```python
 from qiskit_ibm_runtime import SamplerV2 as Sampler, Batch

 max_circuits = 100
 all_partitioned_circuits = []
 for i in range(0, len(circuits), max_circuits):
     all_partitioned_circuits.append(circuits[i : i + max_circuits])
 jobs = []
 start_idx = 0

 with Batch(backend=backend):
     sampler = Sampler()
     for partitioned_circuits in all_partitioned_circuits:
         job = sampler.run(partitioned_circuits)
         jobs.append(job)
```


<Admonition type="caution">
    If you set `backend=backend` in a primitive, the program is run in job mode, even if it's inside a batch or session context. Setting `backend=backend` is deprecated as of IBM Qiskit Runtime 0.24.0.  Instead, use the `mode` parameter.

## Determine batch details

For a comprehensive overview of a batch's configuration and status, including its interactive and max TTL, use the  `batch.details() method`.

``` python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, SamplerV2 as Sampler

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)

with Batch(backend=backend) as batch:
    sampler = Sampler()
    for partition in partitions:
        job = sampler.run(partition)
    print(batch.details())
```



<Admonition type="tip" title="Recommendations">
  - Try an example in the [Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA)](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/tutorial/quantum-approximate-optimization-algorithm) tutorial.
  - Review the [Batch API](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.Batch) reference.
  - Understand the [Job limits](/guides/job-limits) when sending a job to an IBM&reg; QPU.
