# Minimize job run time

There are several ways you can limit the amount of quantum time spent processing and running a job:

- Run only as many iterations and shots as you need: The time your workload takes (and therefore, its cost) depends on how many jobs you create in a session and how many shots are run in each job. Therefore, you can manage your cost by running only as many jobs and shots as you need.

- Set limits on execution time:  You can limit how long each job or session runs.  For details, see [Maximum execution time for a Qiskit Runtime job or session](max-execution-time).

- Use only the necessary settings for error suppression, error mitigation, and optimization, because higher values can cause your jobs to run longer. See [Algorithm tuning options](./runtime-options-overview), [Configure runtime compilation](./configure-error-suppression), and [Configure error mitigation](configure-error-mitigation) for details.
