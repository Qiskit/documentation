# Minimize job run time

There are several ways you can limit the amount of time spent processing and running a job:

- Run only as many shots as you need: The quantum time a job takes (and therefore, its cost) scales with the number of shots. Therefore, you can manage your cost by running only as many shots as you need. For Estimator jobs, lower precision typically requires more shots and therefore longer execution time.

- Set limits on execution time:  You can limit how long each job, batch, or session runs.  For details, see [Maximum execution time for Qiskit Runtime workloads](max-execution-time).

- Use only the necessary settings for error suppression and error mitigation, because higher values can cause your jobs to run longer. See [Introduction to options](./runtime-options-overview), [Configure error suppression](./configure-error-suppression), and [Configure error mitigation](configure-error-mitigation) for details.

- If you are running multiple jobs that contain the same (likely parameterized) circuits and are using an error mitigation method that requires noise models, such as PEA and PEC, consider using `NoiseLearner`. With this helper program, you can learn the noise model of a circuit once and reuse the model in subsequent Estimator queries. Note that a noise model becomes stale after a certain time, so this is only practical if there is no long delay between jobs (for example, within a session). See [Noise learning helper
](./noise-learning) for more details.
