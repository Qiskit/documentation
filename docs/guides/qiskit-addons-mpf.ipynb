    "Multi-product formulas (MPF) can be used to more accurately simulate the dynamics of a quantum system, at the cost of increased circuit executions. This is a post-processing technique that mitigates the error of expectation values for time-evolved states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical computing is used to solve a system of linear equations that provides coefficients to a weighted combination of several circuit executions. Using this weighted combination can reduce the error associated with simulating time evolution, given a good selection of Trotter steps. The MPF tool will ingest a selection of data --- including the number of Trotter steps and the order of the Trotter approximation --- to prepare and solve (or approximate the solution of) the associated system of linear equations, which you can then use to post-process expectation value measurements of a time-evolved state."

    "MPFs can reduce the Trotter approximation error associated with simulating the dynamics of quantum systems through a weighted combination of several circuit executions. This weighted sum is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mu(t) = \\sum_j x_j\\rho_j^{k_j}\\left(\\frac{t}{k_j}\\right) + \\text{some remaining Trotter error}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_j$ are the weighting coefficients, $\\rho_j^{k_j}$ is the density matrix that corresponds to the pure state obtained by evolving the initial state via a product formula $S^{k_j}$ approximating the time-evolution operator using $k_j$ Trotter steps, and $j$ indexes each product formula used in the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Several circuits with a varying number of Trotter steps are used to compute the target observable](/images/guides/qiskit-addons/mpf-diagram.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, however, the goal of simulating quantum dynamics is to measure some observable $\\mathcal{O}(t)$, which is a function of time. When using MPFs, multiple circuits -- each using $k_j$ Trotter steps -- are executed to obtain several measurements of the target observable $\\mathcal{O}_{k_j}(t)$. The measurement of the target observable is then obtained by computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\langle \\mathcal{O}(t) \\rangle = \\sum_j x_j(t) \\langle \\mathcal{O}_{k_j}(t) \\rangle. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, you can reduce the overall Trotter error by approximating the time-evolution operator using several product formulas with a variable number of Trotter steps instead of a single product formula. You construct a circuit for each term in the weighted sum, which evolves the system according to each of the $k_j$ number of Trotter steps. Each circuit is then executed separately on a QPU to reconstruct the results in a post-processing step. The utility of this technique can be viewed from two perspectives:\n",
    "1. For a fixed number of Trotter steps that you execute, you can obtain results with a Trotter error that is smaller in total.\n",
    "2. For a number of Trotter steps that result in deep circuits, you can use MPF to find several shorter-depth circuits to run, which results in a similar Trotter approximation error.\n",

    "## Determine MPF coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality of the `qiskit-addon-mpf` package lies in determining the MPF coefficients $x_j(t)$ (which may be time-dependent). The process to obtain each $x_j(t)$ involves solving a system of linear equations $Ax=b$ where $x$ is the vector of coefficients to be determined, $A$ is a matrix that depends on each of the $k_j$ and the product formula used $S$ (as in, the approximation order and number of Trotter steps), and $b$ is a vector of constraints. This system of equations can be solved either exactly or with an approximate model that minimizes the 1-norm of the coefficients. Additionally, the choice for each $k_j$ is a heuristic process, but can be bounded by the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **largest** $k_j$ value is bounded by the highest depth of circuit that can be reliably executed\n",
    "2. The **smallest** $k_j$ should satisfy $dt = t/k_j < 1$ since that is where the Trotter error is most well behaved\n",
    "3. None of the coefficients $x_j$ should be close to $0$ since this would imply they don't contribute much to the MPF\n",
    "4. Similarly, the coefficient associated with the largest $k_j$ value should not dominate, since this implies that you are using a single product formula\n",
    "5. Lastly, the norm of the coefficients $x_j$ obtained should be small, as this indicates a well-conditioned MPF [1](#references)\n",
