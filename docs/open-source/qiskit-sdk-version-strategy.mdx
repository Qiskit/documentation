# Qiskit SDK version strategy

Qiskit version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
The version number is comprised of three primary components: the major, minor, and
patch versions. For example, in version number `X.Y.Z`, `X` is the major version,
`Y` is the minor version, and `Z` is the patch version.

Breaking API changes are reserved for major version releases. The **minimum**
period between major version releases is one year. Minor versions introduce
new features and bug fixes without breaking API compatibility, and are
periodically (currently every three months) published for **only** the
current major version. Patch versions provide fixes for bugs identified in
the most recent minor version of each actively supported release series (that is, the 
major version). We support at most two release series at a time, which occurs
only during the period of overlap following a new major version release,
described in more detail below.


## Release schedule


A tentative release schedule is included below:

![Tentative Qiskit release schedule](/images/guides/install/release_schedule.avif)

For an up-to-date release schedule, refer to the Qiskit Github project's [milestones list](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/milestones), which will always contain the current release plan.

With the release of a new major version, the previous major version is supported
for at least six months; only bug and security fixes are accepted during this time and only patch releases are published for this major version. A final
patch version is published when support is dropped, and that release 
also documents the end of support for that major version series. A longer
support window is needed for the previous major version as this gives downstream
Qiskit consumers and their users a chance to migrate their code.
Downstream libraries that 
depend on Qiskit should not raise their minimum required Qiskit version to a new
major version immediately after its release because the library's user base needs time 
to migrate to the new API changes. Having an extended support window
for the previous major Qiskit version gives downstream projects time to ensure
compatibility with the next major version. Downstream projects can provide
support for two release series at a time to give their users a migration path.

For the purposes of semantic versioning, the Qiskit public API is considered
any documented module, class, function, or method that is not marked as private
(with an underscore `_` prefix). However, there can be explicit exceptions made for
specific documented APIs. In such cases, these APIs will be clearly documented
as not being considered stable interfaces yet, and a user-visible warning will be
actively emitted on any use of these unstable interfaces. Additionally, in some
situations, an interface marked as private is considered part of the public
API. Typically this only occurs in two cases: either an abstract interface
definition where subclasses are intended to override/implement a private method
as part of defining an implementation of the interface, or advanced-usage
low-level methods that have stable interfaces but are not considered safe to use,
as the burden is on the user to uphold the class/safety invariants themselves
(the canonical example of this is the `QuantumCircuit._append` method).

The supported Python versions, minimum supported Rust version (for building
Qiskit from source), and any Python package dependencies (including the minimum
supported versions of dependencies) used by Qiskit are not part of the backwards
compatibility guarantees and may change during any release. Only minor or major
version releases will raise minimum requirements for using or building Qiskit
(including adding new dependencies), but patch fixes might include support for
new versions of Python or other dependencies. Usually the minimum version of a
dependency is only increased when older dependency versions go out of support or
when it is not possible to maintain compatibility with the latest release of the
dependency and the older version.

## Upgrade strategy

When a new major version is released, the recommended upgrade path
is to first upgrade to the most recent minor version on the previous major
version. Shortly before a new major version, a final minor version will
be published. This final minor version release `X.Y+1.0.0` is equivalent to
`X.Y.0` but with warnings and deprecations for any API changes that are
made on the new major version series.

For example, immediately proceeding the 1.0.0 release, a 0.46.0 release will be
published. The 0.46.0 release will be equivalent to the 0.45.0 release but with
additional deprecation warnings that document the API changes that were made as
part of the 1.0.0 release. This pattern will be used for any future major
version releases.

Qiskit users should first upgrade to this final minor
version to see any deprecation warnings and adjust their Qiskit
usage before trying a potentially breaking release. The previous
major version will be supported for at least six months to give sufficient time
to upgrade. A typical pattern to manage this is to pin the maximum version to
avoid using the next major release series until you're sure of compatibility.
For example, specifying `qiskit<2` in a requirements file when the current
major Qiskit version is 1 ensures that you're using a version of Qiskit
that doesn't have breaking API changes.

Capping the version less than the next major version 
ensures that you see any deprecation warnings before a
major version release. 
Without the cap, `pip` installs 
the newest version available by default.

The QPY serialization format is backwards-compatible so that a new Qiskit release can always load a QPY
file generated with an earlier release of Qiskit. However, the format isn't forward-compatible so, in principle, it's not possible
to load QPY files generated with a newer version of Qiskit using an older release.  To facilitate user migration across major version releases, the [`qiskit.qpy.dump()`](/api/qiskit/qpy#dump) function will always support at least one overlapping version between the `X.0.0` and the `X-1.Y.0` release (where `Y` is the last minor version of 
that series). The parameter `qiskit.qpy.dump(..., version=...)` will enable saving QPY format files that can be loaded by both major versions from the newer
release. See more details in [RFC 0020](https://github.com/Qiskit/RFCs/blob/master/0020-release_cycle.md#qpy-support).

## Pre-releases

For each minor and major version release, Qiskit publishes pre-releases that
are compatible with [PEP440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). Typically
these are release candidates of the form `X.Y.0rc1`. The `rc` releases
will have a finalized API surface and are used to test a prospective release.

Note that when one of the PEP440 pre-release suffixes (such as `a`, `b`, or `pre`) are
published, it does not have the same guarantees as an `rc` release, and is
only a preview release. The API might change between these pre-releases
and the final release with that version number. For example, `1.0.0pre1` might have
a different final API than `1.0.0`.


## Post-releases

If there are issues with a release's packaging, a post-release might be
issued to correct this. These will follow the form `X.Y.Z.1` where the fourth
integer indicates that it is the first post-release of the `X.Y.Z` release.
For example, the qiskit-terra (the legacy package name for Qiskit) 0.25.2
release had some issue with the sdist package publishing, and a post-release
0.25.2.1 was published that corrected this issue. The code was identical, and
0.25.2.1 only fixed the packaging issue for the release.

## How contributors can mark deprecations

Refer to the [deprecation guide](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/DEPRECATION.md) in the Qiskit SDK repository for instructions on how to add deprecations to the source code.
