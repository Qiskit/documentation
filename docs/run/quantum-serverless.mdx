# Run workloads with Quantum Serverless

Premium users can build, deploy, and run their workloads remotely on classical compute made available through the IBM Quantum Platform.

Try out the tutorials in [IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/catalog/tutorials?topics=qiskit-patterns) (note: these are accessible in the Premium Plan once you have logged into your IBM Quantum account) and explore more of the features of Quantum Serverless in the [documentation](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/).

## Qiskit Patterns with Quantum Serverless

Creating utility-scale quantum applications generally requires a variety of compute resource requirements. You can use Quantum Serverless to easily submit quantum workflows for remote, managed execution. These quantum workflows can typically be implemented within a common pattern, called a Qiskit Pattern. A Qiskit Pattern is an intuitive, repeatable set of steps for implementing a quantum computing workflow.

Steps in a Qiskit Pattern:

1. Map classical inputs to a quantum problem
2. Optimize problem for quantum execution
3. Execute using Qiskit Runtime primitives
4. Post-process, return result in classical format

Once you have built a Qiskit Pattern, you can use Quantum Serverless to deploy it and submit it for managed execution. Overall, the process of creating quantum software and submitting it for managed execution on a remote cluster can be broken down into three steps:

5. Build the Qiskit Pattern
6. Deploy to the cloud
7. Run the Qiskit Pattern on the cloud

## Build a Qiskit Pattern

Here is an example of computing the expectation value using the Qiskit Runtime Estimator primitive. This Python script should be saved in your working directory. (Warning! All contents of the working directory will be shipped to the cluster for execution.)

```python
# source_files/my_qiskit_pattern.py

from qiskit import transpile
from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Estimator
from quantum_serverless import save_result

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.least_busy(simulator=False)

# Step 1: Map the classical input to an abstract circuit and observables
abstract_circuit = random_circuit(2, 2, seed=1234)
observable = SparsePauliOp("IY")

# Step 2: Optimize the circuit for quantum execution
target_circuit = transpile(abstract_circuit, backend)
target_observable = observable.apply_layout(target_circuit.layout)

# Step 3: Execute the target circuit
estimator = Estimator(backend)
job = estimator.run(target_circuit, target_observable)
result = job.result()

# Step 4: Postprocess the results
print(result)

# save results of program execution
# note: saved items must be serializable
save_result(result.values)
```

## Deploy a Qiskit Pattern to Quantum Serverless

After creating a pattern, authenticate to the `IBMServerlessProvider` with your IBM Quantum token, which can be obtained from your [IBM Quantum account](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/account), and upload the script.

```python
# Authenticate to the IBM serverless provider
from quantum_serverless import IBMServerlessProvider
serverless = IBMServerlessProvider("YOUR_IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN")

# Deploy the pattern
from quantum_serverless import QiskitPattern
serverless.upload(
    QiskitPattern(
        title="My-Qiskit-Pattern",
        entrypoint="my_qiskit_pattern.py",
        working_dir="./source_files/"
    )
)
```

## Run a Qiskit Pattern remotely on Quantum Serverless

Finally, the pattern is ready to run remotely.

```python
# Run pattern remotely
job = serverless.run("My-Qiskit-Pattern")

# Retrieve status, logs, results
job.status()
job.logs()
job.result()
```

## Migration guide

Qiskit Runtime custom programs can be easily migrated to Quantum Serverless via this [migration guide](https://qiskit-extensions.github.io/quantum-serverless/migration/migration_from_qiskit_runtime_programs.html).

## Resource Management (Alpha)

Premium Plan users have access to an alpha release of resource management functionality through Quantum Serverless. This enables automatic selection of quantum hardware for your workloads. A how-to guide is available on [IBM Quantum Learning](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/tutorial/resource-management-automatically-select-quantum-hardware).
