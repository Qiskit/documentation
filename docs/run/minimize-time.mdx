# Minimize job usage

There are several ways you can limit the amount of quantum time spent processing and running a job:

- Run only as many iterations and shots as you need: The time your workload takes (and therefore, its cost) depends on how many jobs you make in a session and how many shots are run in each job. Therefore, you can manage your cost by running only as many jobs and shots as you need.

- Set limits on execution time:  You can limit how long each job or session runs.  For details, see [Maximum execution time for a Qiskit Runtime job or session](max-execution-time).

- Use only the necessary settings for error suppression, error mitigation, and optimization, because higher values can cause your jobs to run longer. See [Algorithm tuning options](../optimization/algorithm-tuning-options), [Configure error suppression](../optimization/error-suppression), and [Configure error mitigation](../optimization/error-mitigation) for details.
