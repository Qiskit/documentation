description: Estimate how long a job that uses a primitive will take to run

# Estimate job run time

After submitting a job to the IBM Quantum channel, you can see an estimation for how long the job will take to run in quantum seconds. You can use `job.usage_estimation`.  Alternatively, you can view this information on the IBM Quantum Platform user interface.

<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
    - This only applies to jobs that use primitives.
    - This is not yet available on the IBM Qiskit Runtime on Cloud channel. 
</Admonition>

Example:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Sampler

service = QiskitRuntimeService()

# Create a new circuit with two qubits (first argument) and two classical
# bits (second argument)
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Add a Hadamard gate to qubit 0
qc.h(0)

# Perform a controlled-X gate on qubit 1, controlled by qubit 0
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure qubit 0 to cbit 0, and qubit 1 to cbit 1
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.measure(1, 1)

# Run on the least-busy backend you have access to
backend = service.least_busy(simulator=False,operational=True)

# Create a Sampler object
sampler = Sampler(backend)

# Submit the circuit to the sampler
job = sampler.run(qc)

print(job.usage_estimation)
```

Output:

```python
{'quantum_seconds': 4.1058720028432445}
```
## View the estimated job usage on IBM Quantum Platform

You can view the estimated usage (in quantum seconds) in two places on IBM Quantum Platform:

- On the [Jobs table](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jobs) in the Usage column.  From the Home page, click *View all* on the Recent jobs table.  The Usage column shows the estimated usage for pending jobs, or actual usage for completed jobs. 
- On the job's details page. From the [Dashboard](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) or [Jobs table](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/jobs), click the job ID to open the job details page.  The estimated usage is shown in the Status Timeline.
