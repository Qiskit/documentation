# Run on quantum backends

A **backend** represents either a simulator or a real quantum computer and are responsible for running quantum circuits, running pulse schedules, and returning results.

In qiskit-ibm-runtime, a backend is represented by an instance of the `IBMBackend` class. Attributes of this class provides information about this backend. For example:

*   `name`: Name of the backend.
*   `instructions`: A list of instructions the backend supports.
*   `operation_names`: A list of instruction names the backend supported.
*   `num_qubits`: The number of qubits the backend has.
*   `coupling_map`: Coupling map of the backend.
*   `dt`: System time resolution of input signals.
*   `dtm`: System time resolution of output signals.

Refer to the [API reference](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMBackend#ibmbackend) for a complete list of attributes and methods.

## Connect to an instance

You can specify an instance when initializing the service or provider, or when choosing a backend. See [Connect to an instance](instances#connect-instance) in the Instances topic for full details.

**Examples**

### qiskit-ibm-runtime

```python

# Optional: List all the instances you can access.
service = QiskitRuntimeService(channel='ibm_quantum')
print(service.instances())

# Optional: Specify it at service level. This becomes the default unless overwritten.
service = QiskitRuntimeService(instance="hub1/group1/project1")
backend1 = service.backend("ibmq_manila")

# Optional: Specify it at the backend level, which overwrites the service-level specification when this backend is used. 
backend2 = service.backend("ibmq_manila", instance="hub2/group2/project2")

sampler1 = Sampler(backend=backend1)    # this will use hub1/group1/project1
sampler2 = Sampler(backend=backend2)    # this will use hub2/group2/project2
```

### qiskit-ibm-provider

```python
from qiskit_ibm_provider import IBMProvider

provider = IBMProvider(instance="hub1/group1/project1")
backend1 = provider.get_backend("ibmq_manila")
backend2 = provider.get_backend("ibmq_manila", instance="hub2/group2/project2")

job1 = backend1.run(...)    # this will use hub1/group1/project1
job2 = backend2.run(...)    # this will use hub2/group2/project2
```


## Initialize the service

Before calling `IBMBackend`, initialize the service:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
# Initialize the account first.
service = QiskitRuntimeService()
```

## List backends

To view the backends you have access to, you can either view a list on the [Compute resources page](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services/resources?tab=yours), or you can use the `backends()` method. This method returns a list of `IBMBackend` instances:

```python
service.backends()
```

```
[<IBMBackend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')>,
<IBMBackend('simulator_stabilizer')>,
<IBMBackend('simulator_mps')>,
<IBMBackend('simulator_extended_stabilizer')>,
<IBMBackend('simulator_statevector')>]
```

The `backend()` (note that this is singular: *backend*) method takes the name of the backend as the input parameter and returns an `IBMBackend` instance representing that particular backend:

```python
service.backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
```

```
<IBMBackend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')>
```

## Filter backends

You may also optionally filter the set backends, by passing arguments that query the backend’s configuration, status, or properties. For more general filters, you can make advanced functions using a lambda function. Refer to the API documentation for more details.

Let’s try getting only backends that fit these criteria:

*   Are real quantum devices (`simulator=False`)
*   Are currently operational (`operational=True`)
*   Have at least 5 qubits (`min_num_qubits=5`)

```python
service.backends(simulator=False, operational=True, min_num_qubits=5)
```

A similar method is `least_busy()`, which takes the same filters as `backends()` but returns the backend that matches the filters and has the least number of jobs pending in the queue:

```python
service.least_busy(operational=True, min_num_qubits=5)
```

## Determine backend attributes

As mentioned previously, the `IBMBackend` class attributes provide information about the backend. For example:

```python
backend = service.backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
backend.name #returns the backend's name
backend.backend_version #returns the version number
backend.simulator #returns True or False, depending on whether it is a simulator
backend.num_qubits #returns the number of qubits the backend has
```

See the [IBMBackend class documentation](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/qiskit_ibm_runtime.IBMBackend#ibmbackend) for the full list of backend attributes.

## Find backend information from other channels

To find your available systems and simulators on **IBM Cloud**, view the [IBM Cloud Compute resources page](https://cloud.ibm.com/quantum/resources/your-resources). You must be logged in to see your available compute resources. You are shown a snapshot of each backend. To see full details, click the backend name. You can also search for backends from this page.

To find your available systems and simulators on **IBM Quantum Platform**, view the [Platform Compute resources page](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services/resources). You are shown a snapshot of each backend. To see full details, click the backend name. You can also sort, filter, and search from this page.

## Specify a backend when running a job

If you are using a runtime session, add the `backend` option when starting your session. For details about working with sessions, see [Run jobs in a session](run-sessions).

```python
from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, Estimator, Options

circuit = random_circuit(2, 2, seed=1).decompose(reps=1)
observable = SparsePauliOp("IY")

options = Options()
options.optimization_level = 2
options.resilience_level = 2

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
with Session(service=service, backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator") as session:
     estimator = Estimator(session=session, options=options)
     job = estimator.run(circuit, observable)
     result = job.result()
     # Close the session only if all jobs are finished, and you don't need to run more in the session
     session.close() # Closes the session

display(circuit.draw("mpl"))
print(f" > Observable: {observable.paulis}")
print(f" > Expectation value: {result.values[0]}")
print(f" > Metadata: {result.metadata[0]}")
```
If you are not using a runtime session, you can pass the backend when initializing the primitive class.

``` python
  from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit
  from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
  from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService, Session, Estimator, Options
  
  circuit = random_circuit(2, 2, seed=1).decompose(reps=1)
  observable = SparsePauliOp("IY")
  
  options = Options()
  options.optimization_level = 2
  options.resilience_level = 2
  
  service = QiskitRuntimeService()
  estimator = Estimator(backend="ibmq_qasm_simulator", options=options)
  job = estimator.run(circuit, observable)
  result = job.result()
  
  display(circuit.draw("mpl"))
  print(f" > Observable: {observable.paulis}")
  print(f" > Expectation value: {result.values[0]}")
  print(f" > Metadata: {result.metadata[0]}")
  ```
