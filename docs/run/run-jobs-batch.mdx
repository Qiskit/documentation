# Run jobs in a batch

Batch mode can shorten processing time if all jobs can be provided at the outset. If you want to submit iterative jobs, use [sessions](sessions) instead.  Using batch mode has these benefits:

-  The jobs' classical computation, such as compilation, is run in parallel. Thus, runing multiple jobs in a batch is significantly faster than running them serially. 
-  There is no delay between job, which can help avoid drift.

<Admonition type="note">
    When batching, jobs are not guaranteed to run in the order they are submitted.

The following example shows how you can divide up a long list of circuits into multiple jobs and run them as a batch to take advantage of the parallel processing.

```python
jobs = []
with Batch(backend) as batch:
    estimator = Estimator(batch)
    # calls within this context are part of the batch.
    for obs_set in observable_sets:
        jobs.append(estimator.run(circuits, observables=obs_set))
```
