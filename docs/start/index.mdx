# Introduction

The quantum community has explored quantum computing on the cloud since 2016.  Now the community has a new challenge: *demonstrate useful quantum computation*. 

Through IBM Quantum, you have access to performant and utility-scale (>100-qubit) quantum systems for your work, as well as scalable and flexible quantum software. Whether you try out a no-cost plan or run your programs through a pay-as-you-go or premium plan, you can start doing useful work with quantum computing now.

The sections at the core of our documentation are based on the stages of a typical quantum user’s journey: build quantum circuits and operators in Qiskit, then transpile and run on quantum systems using Qiskit Runtime primitives, a simplified interface for circuit execution. By pairing Qiskit with Qiskit Runtime, you benefit from seamless circuit execution powered by advanced runtime compilation, error suppression, and error mitigation techniques. 
 
If you’re just getting started with IBM Quantum, you are in the right place. Use the topics in this section to get ready, then proceed to [Build](../build) to create your first quantum circuit. Keep working through the sections in order, following the tabs at the top of this page.

Already know what you’re looking for?

- [Install](install): Begin using our tools and platforms with install and setup instructions.

- [Build](../build): Design and develop quantum circuits with primitives and advanced methods like dynamic circuits and mid-circuit measurements. You can also find our circuit library here.

- [Verify](../verify): Validate and evaluate your quantum circuits.

- [Run](../run): Run on our hardware with job configuration options such as sessions.

- [Transpile](../transpile): Compile locally to transform your circuits to be hardware-executable, with varying degrees of error awareness.

- **API reference**: Find API references for [Qiskit](/api/qiskit), [Qiskit Runtime IBM Client](/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/runtime_service), [Qiskit IBM Runtime Rest API](/api/runtime/tags/programs), and [Qiskit IBM Provider](/api/qiskit-ibm-provider/ibm_provider) in the API reference drop-down menu above. You can also find the [Error code registry](../errors) here.
