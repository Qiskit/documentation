# Accessibility features for IBM Quantum Platform

Accessibility features assist users who have a disability, such as restricted mobility or limited vision, to use information technology content successfully.

## Accessibility features

IBM Quantum&reg; Platform includes the following major accessibility features:

* Keyboard-only operation
* Operations that use a screen reader

IBM Quantum Platform uses the W3C Standard, [WAI-ARIA 1.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/), to ensure compliance to ensure compliance to [US Section 508](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/), [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), and [EN 301 549](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/02.01.02_60/en_301549v020102p.pdf). To take advantage of accessibility features, use the latest release of your screen reader in combination with the latest Chrome web browser that is supported by this product.

The IBM Quantum Platform online product documentation and the IBM Quantum Platform user interface framework are enabled for accessibility.


## Interface information

Review the following information about the IBM Quantum Platform user interface:

* If you are using a screen reader with the IBM Quantum Platform web user interface or product documentation, use the latest version of Chrome with the latest release of the screen reader.
* If you are using keyboard operation only on a Mac product, ensure that your MacOS setting is enabled for `Keyboard navigation: Use keyboard navigation to move focus between controls`.
* The IBM Quantum Platform user interface does not have content that flashes 2 - 55 times per second.
* The IBM Quantum Platform web user interface relies on cascading style sheets to render content properly and to provide a usable experience. The application provides an equivalent way for low-vision users to use their system display settings, including high-contrast mode. You can control font size by using the device or web browser settings.
* The IBM Quantum Platform web user interface includes WAI-ARIA navigational landmarks that you can use to quickly navigate to functional areas in the application.
