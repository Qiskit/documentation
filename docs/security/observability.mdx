# Activity tracking events for Qiskit Runtime Service

IBM Cloud&reg; services, such as Qiskit Runtime Service, generate activity tracking events.

Activity tracking events report on activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. You can use the events to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements.

You can use IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing, a platform service, to route auditing events in your account to destinations of your choice by configuring targets and routes that define where activity tracking events are sent. For more information, see [About IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Events Routing.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-about)

You can use IBM Cloud Logs to visualize and alert on events that are generated in your account and routed by IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing to an IBM Cloud Logs instance.

## Locations where activity tracking events are generated

Qiskit Runtime Service sends activity tracking events in the following regions:

- Washington (`us-east`)
- Frankfurt (`eu-de`)

## Viewing activity tracking events for Qiskit Runtime Service

You can use IBM Cloud Logs to visualize and alert on events that are generated in your account and routed by IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing to an IBM Cloud Logs instance.

### Launching IBM Cloud Logs from the Observability page

For information on launching the IBM Cloud Logs UI, see [Launching the UI in the IBM Cloud Logs](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-instance-launch) documentation.


## List of platform events

<!-- This section only applies to catalog services and can be deleted if the service is not a catalog service. -->

The following table lists the activity tracking event actions that the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform generates when Qiskit Runtime Service instances are processed.

| Action                                   | Description |
|------------------------------------------|---------|
| `<service-name>.instance.create`           | An event is generated when you provision a service instance. |
| `<service-name>.instance.update`           | An event is generated when you rename a service instance or when you change the service plan. |
| `<service-name>.instance.delete`           | An event is generated when a service instance is deleted. |
| `<service-name>.instance.schedule_reclaim` | An event is generated when a service instance is pending_reclamation. |
| `<service-name>.instance.restore`          | An event is generated when a service instance is restored. |

The following table lists the actions that generate an event for managing service credentials that are associated with a service instance.

| Action                         | Description |
|--------------------------------|---------|
| `<service_name>.key.create` | An event is generated when an API key is created for a service instance through the *Service credentials* section of the service instance UI. |
| `<service_name>.key.delete` | An event is generated when an API key that is associated with a service instance is deleted from the *Service credentials* section of the service instance UI. |
