# Activity tracking events for Qiskit Runtime Service

IBM Cloud&reg; services, such as Qiskit Runtime Service, generate activity tracking events.

Activity tracking events report on activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. You can use the events to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements.

You can use IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing, a platform service, to route auditing events in your account to destinations of your choice by configuring targets and routes that define where activity tracking events are sent. For more information, see [About IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Events Routing.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/atracker?topic=atracker-about)

You can use IBM Cloud Logs to visualize and alert on events that are generated in your account and routed by IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing to an IBM Cloud Logs instance.


## Locations where activity tracking events are generated
{: #at-locations}

<!-- NOTE: If your service generates events in only one region, this table can be replaced with a simple paragraph noting the region where events are generated. -->

<!-- Make sure to update this table as new regions are supported by your service. -->

_service-name_ sends activity tracking events by {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} in the regions that are indicated in the following table.

| Dallas (`us-south`) | Washington (`us-east`)  | Toronto (`ca-tor`) | Montreal (`ca-mon`) | Sao Paulo (`br-sao`) |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| [No]{: tag-red} | [No]{: tag-red} | [No]{: tag-red} | [No]{: tag-red} | [No]{: tag-red} |

## Enabling activity tracking events for _service-name_
{: #at-enable}

<!-- If your service requires specific enablement for activity tracking events to occur, include those details in this section. If activity tracking events are done by default and requires no customer configuration, you can eliminate this section. -->

<!-- Option 1: If your service requires a paid plan or additional configuration for activity tracking events -->
<!-- Some services require a paid plan or additional configuration to enable events. Add any information on how to allow the customer to generate events. Include steps required to enable using the UI, CLI, API, and Terraform as appropriate. Include examples.

<!-- Option 2
<!-- If your service sends audit events (activity tracking events) using logging, include any instructions required to add those logs as platform logs (PGaudit logs). -->


## Viewing activity tracking events for _service-name_
{: #at-viewing}

<!-- Include the appropriate information for your service. -->

You can use {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} to visualize and alert on events that are generated in your account and routed by {{site.data.keyword.atracker_full_notm}} to an {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} instance.

### Launching {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} from the _service-name_ dashboard
{: #log-launch-integrated}

<!-- Include if your service allows direct access to IBM Cloud Logs from the service UI. Include steps on how to access IBM Cloud Logs from your service. If your service does not allow direct access, this section can be removed. -->

### Launching {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} from the Observability page
{: #log-launch-standalone}

<!-- This section must always be included -->

For information on launching the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} UI, see [Launching the UI in the {{site.data.keyword.logs_full_notm}} documentation.](/docs/cloud-logs?topic=cloud-logs-instance-launch)


## List of platform events
{: #at_actions_platform}

<!-- This section only applies to catalog services and can be deleted if the service is not a catalog service. -->

The following table lists the activity tracking event actions that the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} platform generates _service-name_ instances are processed.

| Action                                   | Description |
|------------------------------------------|---------|
| `<service-name>.instance.create`           | An event is generated when you provision a service instance. |
| `<service-name>.instance.update`           | An event is generated when you rename a service instance or when you change the service plan. |
| `<service-name>.instance.delete`           | An event is generated when a service instance is deleted. |
| `<service-name>.instance.schedule_reclaim` | An event is generated when a service instance is pending_reclamation. |
| `<service-name>.instance.restore`          | An event is generated when a service instance is restored. |
{: caption="Actions that generate platform events" caption-side="bottom"}

The following table lists the actions that generate an event for managing service credentials that are associated with a service instance.

| Action                         | Description |
|--------------------------------|---------|
| `<service_name>.key.create` | An event is generated when an API key is created for a service instance through the *Service credentials* section of the service instance UI. |
| `<service_name>.key.delete` | An event is generated when an API key that is associated with a service instance is deleted from the *Service credentials* section of the service instance UI. |
