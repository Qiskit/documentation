# Understanding high availability and disaster recovery for Qiskit Runtime

High availability (HA) is the ability for a service to remain operational and accessible in the presence of unexpected failures. Disaster recovery is the process of recovering the service instance to a working state. Qiskit Runtime customers are not responsible for disaster recovery planning or actions.

Qiskit Runtime is a regional service that fulfills the defined [Service Level Objectives (SLO)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/resiliency?topic=resiliency-slo) with any paid plan.

## High availability architecture

### High availability features

This service is provisioned across two zones in a multi-zone region with no single point of failure. API requests are routed through a load balancer to the HA instance nodes, each in a different zone.

If an HA instance node or zone fails, the service continues to run API requests through to the surviving HA instance nodes.  No noticeable degradation of service occurs during a zonal failure.

It available in the following regions:

- Washington DC (us-east)
- Frankfurt (eu-de)
