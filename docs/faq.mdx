## Trouble creating an IBM Cloud account

If you get an error when you create an IBM Cloud&reg; account, first check whether you have access to the [Support center.](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter)

- If you do have access, click "create case", then select *Account* as the Topic and *Account verification* as the Subtopic.
- If you do not have access, contact Support by calling 1-866-325-0045 and selecting the third option.

See [Why is my account inactive?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-ts_accnt_inactive) and [Why does a resource group error occur after reactivation or upgrade of a suspended account?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-resource_inactive) for more information.

## How do I cite Qiskit in my research?

Cite Qiskit by using the included [BibTeX file](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/CITATION.bib).

## How do I cite an IBM Quantum computer in my research?

For research papers, we encourage authors to acknowledge IBM Quantum&reg; by using:

>    We acknowledge the use of IBM Quantum services for this work. The views expressed are those of the authors, and do not reflect the official policy or position of IBM or the IBM Quantum team.

Paper references should be cited as follows:

> IBM Quantum. https://<span>quantum.ibm.com</span>/, 2021

Quantum processing units in the paper should be referenced by their unique name (for example, `ibmq_vigo`) and optionally
adding the version (for example, `ibmq_vigo` v1.0.2).  We also encourage referencing the processor.
For example:

> In this paper we used `ibmq_vigo`, which is one of the IBM Quantum Canary processors.

Example of citing an IBM Quantum program:

> IBM Quantum (2022). Estimator primitive (Version x.y.z) [computer software]. https://<span>quantum.ibm.com</span>/

## How do I cite IBM Quantum Composer in my research?

Example of citing IBM Quantum Composer:

> IBM Quantum Composer. 2023. url: https://<span>quantum.ibm.com/composer</span>

## I'm an administrator but I can't access my administration tasks.

Try choosing a different account from the account switcher in the top header of the [IBM Quantum Platform interface](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com).

## I don't see something in the user interface.

Try choosing a different account from the account switcher in the top header of the [IBM Quantum Platform interface](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com).

## I'm just using the Open Plan, but I had to put in my credit card.  Will I be charged?

You will not be charged unless you create a Standard Plan [instance](/docs/guides/instances) and use it to send workloads to QPUs. See [Manage cost on the Standard Plan](/docs/guides/manage-cost) for instructions to set a cost limit and to learn about other ways to manage costs.

## What happened to Python distributions such as Qiskit Aer, Qiskit Nature, and Qiskit Experiments?

Since the release of the Qiskit SDK v1.0, the command `pip install qiskit` will **only** install the [Qiskit SDK](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit). This means that some modules that you have used in the past, such as `qiskit-aer` or `qiskit-nature`, now have to be installed separately.

Before the release of the Qiskit SDK v1.0, Qiskit was comprised of many different Python distributions, such as `qiskit-terra`, the compiler core; `qiskit-aer`, the high-performance simulator; the original IBM Quantum&reg; provider; and several now-obsolete packages providing particular exploratory algorithmic or experiment-running features.

These separate software packages were combined into what was called the Qiskit *metapackage*, which allowed users to install all of these components together through `pip install qiskit`. This metapackage architecture was removed with the release of the Qiskit SDK v1.0, and now each of the individual software distributions needs to be installed separately.

If you want to install the packages that were previously included in the Qiskit metapackage, visit the [Qiskit ecosystem](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/ecosystem) to find a range of packages to suit your needs. You can also read the [v1.0 migration guide](/docs/migration-guides/metapackage-migration) for more information about this change.

## Why do I receive the error message "AttributeError: `QuantumCircuit` object has no attribute `save_state`" when using `save_*`method on a circuit?

The `save_*` instructions are part of Qiskit Aer project,
a high performance simulator for quantum circuits. These instructions do not
exist outside of Qiskit Aer and are added dynamically to the
[QuantumCircuit](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit#quantumcircuit-class) class by Qiskit Aer on import. To
use these instructions you must first import
`qiskit_aer` in your program. Refer
to the [qiskit_aer.library](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/apidocs/aer_library.html) for details.

## Why do my results from real devices differ from my results from the simulator?

The simulator models an ideal environment, without noise or decoherence. When jobs are run on the real devices, noise from the environment and decoherence cause the qubits to behave differently than in an ideal environment.
