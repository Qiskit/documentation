## Get help with Qiskit and IBM Quantum Platform

<Admonition type="caution" title="Having trouble logging in?">

If you get an error when you create an IBM Cloud&reg; account, first check whether you have access to the [Support center.](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter)

- If you do have access, click "create case", then select *Account* as the Topic and *Account verification* as the Subtopic.
- If you do not have access, contact Support by calling 1-866-325-0045 and selecting the third option.

See [Why is my account inactive?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-ts_accnt_inactive) and [Why does a resource group error occur after reactivation or upgrade of a suspended account?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-resource_inactive) for more information.
