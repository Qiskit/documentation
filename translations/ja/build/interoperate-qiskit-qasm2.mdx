# OpenQASM 2 and Qiskit

Qiskit provides some tools for converting between OpenQASM representations of quantum programs, and the [QuantumCircuit](../api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit) class.

## Import an OpenQASM 2 program into Qiskit

Currently two high-level functions are available for importing from OpenQASM 2 into Qiskit. These functions are `qasm2.load()`, which takes a file name, and `qasm2.loads()`, which takes the program itself as a string. 

```python
qiskit.qasm2.load(filename, *, include_path=('.',), include_input_directory='append', custom_instructions=(), custom_classical=(), strict=False)
```

See the [OpenQASM 2 Qiskit API](/api/qiskit/qasm2) for more information. 

### Example: import an OpenQASM 2 program as a string

Use `qasm2.loads()` to import an OpenQASM 2 program as a string into a QuantumCircuit:

```python
import qiskit.qasm2
program = '''
    OPENQASM 2.0;
    include "qelib1.inc";
    qreg q[2];
    creg c[2];

    h q[0];
    cx q[0], q[1];

    measure q -> c;
'''
circuit = qiskit.qasm2.loads(program)
circuit.draw()
```

### Example: import an OpenQASM 2 program from a file

Use `load()` to import an OpenQASM 2 program from a file into a QuantumCircuit:

```python
import qiskit.qasm2
circuit = qiskit.qasm2.load("myfile.qasm")
```

## Custom quantum instructions

You can extend the quantum components of the OpenQASM 2 language by passing an iterable of information on custom instructions as the argument `custom_instructions`. In files that have compatible definitions for these instructions, the given constructor will be used in place of whatever other handling `qiskit.qasm2` would have done.  You cannot provide a custom instruction that has a different number of parameters or qubits from a defined instruction in a parsed program. Each element of the argument iterable should be a particular data class as follows:

#### `qiskit.qasm2.CustomInstruction(name, num_params, num_qubits, constructor, builtin=False)`

The CustomInstruction class gives information about a custom instruction that should be defined during the parse.

The `constructor` field should be a callable object with signature `*args -> Instruction`, where each of the `num_params` args is a floating-point value. Most of the built-in Qiskit gate classes have this form.

The `builtin` field is optional. If set to `true`, the instruction will be defined and available within the parsing, even if there is no definition in any included OpenQASM 2 file. Instructions marked as `builtin` do not require an opaque or gate declaration, but they will silently ignore a compatible declaration.

### Example: use custom quantum instructions

Use `qasm2.loads()` to import an OpenQASM 2 program as a string into a QuantumCircuit, but use a custom quantum instruction.  Sometimes you might  want to influence the gate objects that the importer emits for given named instructions. Gates that are defined by the statement `include "qelib1.inc"` are automatically associated with a suitable Qiskit circuit-library gate, but you can extend this:

```python
from qiskit.circuit import Gate
from qiskit import qasm2

class MyGate(Gate):
    def __init__(self, theta):
        super().__init__("my", 2, [theta])

class Builtin(Gate):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("builtin", 1, [])

program = '''
    opaque my(theta) q1, q2;
    qreg q[2];
    my(0.5) q[0], q[1];
    builtin q[0];
    '''
customs = [
    qasm2.CustomInstruction(name="my", num_params=1, num_qubits=2, constructor=MyGate),
    # Setting 'builtin=True' means the instruction doesn't require a declaration to be usable.
    qasm2.CustomInstruction("builtin", 0, 1, Builtin, builtin=True),
]
circuit = qasm2.loads(program, custom_instructions=customs)
```

<span id="custom-classical"></span>
## Custom classical functions

You can extend the processing done to classical expressions (arguments to gates) by passing an iterable to the argument `custom_classical`. This needs the name (a valid OpenQASM 2 identifier), the number of parameters it takes (num_params), and a Python callable that implements the function. The Python callable must be able to accept `num_params` positional floating-point arguments, and must return a float or integer (which will be converted to a float). Built-in functions cannot be overridden. 

#### `qiskit.qasm2.CustomClassical`

The `CustomClassical` class gives information about a custom classical function that should be defined in mathematical expressions.

The given `callable` must be a Python function that takes `num_params` floats, and returns a float. The `name` is the identifier that refers to it in the OpenQASM 2 program. This cannot clash with any defined gates.

### Example: use custom classical instructions

Use `qasm2.loads()` to import an OpenQASM 2 program as a string into a QuantumCircuit, but use a custom classical instruction.  You can add new classical functions used during the description of arguments to gates, both in the main body of the program (which come out constant-folded) and within the bodies of defined gates (which are computed on demand). Here we provide a Python version of `atan2(y, x)`, which mathematically is $\\atan(y/x)$, but correctly handles angle quadrants and infinities, and a custom `add_one` function:

```python
import math
from qiskit.qasm2 

program = '''
    include "qelib1.inc";
    qreg q[2];
    rx(atan2(pi, 3 + add_one(0.2))) q[0];
    cx q[0], q[1];
'''

def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

customs = [
    # `atan2` takes two parameters, and `math.atan2` implements it.
    qasm2.CustomClassical("atan2", 2, math.atan2),
    # Our `add_one` takes only one parameter.
    qasm2.CustomClassical("add_one", 1, add_one),
]
circuit = qasm2.loads(program, custom_classical=customs)
```

## Strict mode

By default, this parser is a little bit more relaxed than the official specification. It allows trailing commas in parameter lists; unnecessary (empty-statement) semicolons; the `OPENQASM 2.0;` version statement to be omitted; and a couple of other quality-of-life improvements without emitting any errors. However, you can use the "letter-of-the-spec" mode with `strict=True`.
