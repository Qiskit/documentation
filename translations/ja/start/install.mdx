# Install and set up Qiskit

Whether you will work locally or in a cloud environment, the first step for all users is to install Qiskit. For those wanting to run on a real backend, your next step is to choose one of two channels in order to access IBM Quantum systems: IBM Quantum Platform or IBM Cloud.

<span id="local"></span>
## Install and set up Qiskit with the Qiskit Runtime Client

1.  Install Python. Check the requirements in the [setup.py](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/main/setup.py) file to determine which Python versions are supported.  For download instructions, see the [Python Beginners Guide.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

    We recommend that you use [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) to separate Qiskit from other applications.  We also recommend that you use the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install) development environment to interact with Qiskit.

    1.  Create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it.

        <OperatingSystemTabs>
          <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

        <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment
            ```
          </TabItem>

        <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
            ```text
            python3 -m venv c:\path\to\virtual\environment
            ```
          </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

    2.  Activate your new environment.

        <OperatingSystemTabs>
           <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

        <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
             ```shell
             source /path/to/virtual/environment/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

        <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
             ```text
             c:\path\to\virtual\environment\Scripts\Activate.ps1
             ```
           </TabItem>
         </OperatingSystemTabs>

2.  [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

3.  Install the following packages.

    <Admonition type="note">
          Periodically rerun these commands or check the [Qiskit release notes](../api/qiskit/release-notes) and the [Qiskit Runtime release notes](../api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/release-notes) so that you always have the latest versions.
      </Admonition>

    ```shell
    pip install qiskit
    ```

    ```shell
    pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime
    ```

      Run `pip list` to see the active packages in your virtual environment.

      If you intend to use visualization functionality or Jupyter notebooks, it is recommended to install Qiskit with the extra visualization support. Note that **zsh users** need to put `'qiskit[visualization]'` in single quotes.

    ```shell
    pip install qiskit[visualization]
    ```

      zsh users:

    ```shell
    pip install 'qiskit[visualization]'
    ```

If you are planning to work locally and use simulators built into Qiskit, then your installation is done. If you want to run jobs on IBM Quantum systems, next [select an access channel](setup-channel) and finish your setup.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
  <summary>
    "No Module 'qiskit'" error with Jupyter Notebook
  </summary>
  If you used ``pip install qiskit`` and set up your virtual environment in
  Anaconda, then you may get the ``No Module 'qiskit'`` error when you run a tutorial
  in Jupyter Notebook. If you have not installed Qiskit or set up your
  virtual environment, you can follow the [installation](#qiskit-install) steps.

  The error is caused when trying to import the Qiskit package in an
  environment where Qiskit is not installed. If you launched Jupyter Notebook
  from the Anaconda-Navigator, it is possible that Jupyter Notebook is running
  in the base (root) environment, instead of in your virtual
  environment. Choose a virtual environment in the Anaconda-Navigator from the
  **Applications on** dropdown menu. In this menu, you can see
  all of the virtual environments within Anaconda, and you can
  select the environment where you have Qiskit installed to launch Jupyter
  Notebook.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Compilation errors during installation
  </summary>
  Qiskit depends on a number of other open-source Python packages, which
  are automatically installed when doing ``pip install qiskit``. Depending on
  your system's platform and Python version, it is possible that a particular
  package does not provide pre-built binaries for your system. You can refer
  to [Operating system support](#operating-system-support) for a list of platforms supported by Qiskit, some
  of which may need an extra compiler. In cases where there are
  no precompiled binaries available, ``pip`` will attempt to compile the package
  from source, which in turn might require some extra dependencies that need to
  be installed manually.

  If the output of `pip install qiskit` contains similar lines to:

```
Failed building wheel for SOME_PACKAGE
...
build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.5/_openssl.c:498:30: fatal error
compilation terminated.
error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

  please check the documentation of the package that failed to install (in the
  example code, `SOME_PACKAGE`) for information on how to install the libraries
  needed for compiling from source.

## Operating system support

Qiskit strives to support as many operating systems as possible, but due to limitations in available testing resources and operating system availability, not all operating systems can be supported. Operating system support for Qiskit is broken into three tiers with different levels of support for each tier. For operating systems outside these, Qiskit is probably still installable, but it is not tested and you will have to build Qiskit (and likely Qiskit’s dependencies) from source.

Additionally, Qiskit only supports CPython. Running with other Python interpreters is not supported.

<details>
  <summary>
    Tier 1
  </summary>
  Tier 1 operating systems are fully tested as part of the development processes to ensure any proposed change will function correctly. Pre-compiled binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the release process. Typically, as long as there is a functioning Python environment installed, Qiskit can be installed on these operating systems without needing to install further dependencies.

  Tier 1 operating systems:

-   Linux x86_64 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification).
-   macOS x86_64 (10.12 or later)
-   Windows 64 bit
    </details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Tier 2
  </summary>
  Tier 2 operating systems are not tested as part of development process. However, pre-compiled binaries are built, tested, and published to PyPI as part of the release process and these packages can be expected to be installed with just a functioning Python environment.

  Tier 2 operating systems:

-   Linux AArch64 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
    </details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Tier 3
  </summary>
  Tier 3 operating systems are not tested as part of the development process. Pre-compiled binaries are built and published to PyPI as part of the release process but are not tested. They may not be installable with just a functioning Python environment and might require a C/C++ compiler or additional programs to build dependencies from source as part of the installation process. Support for these operating systems are best effort only.

  Tier 3 operating systems:

-   Linux ppc64le (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/)packaging specification)
-   Linux s390x (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
-   macOS ARM64 (10.15 or newer)
-   Linux i686 (distributions compatible with the [manylinux 2014](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0599/) packaging specification)
-   Windows 32 bit

## Qiskit versioning

  Qiskit version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
  The version number is comprised of three primary components: the major, minor, and
  patch versions. For a version number `X.Y.Z` where `X` is the major version,
  `Y` is the minor version, and `Z` is the patch version.

  Breaking API changes are reserved for major version releases. The **minimum**
  period between major version releases is one year. Minor versions introduce
  new features and bug fixes without breaking API compatibility, and are
  periodically (currently every three months) published for **only** the
  current major version. Patch versions provide fixes for bugs identified in
  the most recent minor version of each actively supported release series (i.e.
  major version). We support at most two release series at a time, which occurs
  only during the period of overlap following anew major version release,
  described in more detail below.

<details>
  <summary>
    Release schedule
  </summary>
  A tentative release schedule is included below:

  ![](/images/start/install/release_schedule.png)

  For an up-to-date release schedule, refer to the Qiskit Github project's
  [milestones list](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/milestones), which will always
  contain the current release plan.

  With the release of a new major version, the previous major version is supported
  for at least 6 months; only bug and security fixes will be accepted during this
  time and only patch releases will be published for this major version. A final
  patch version will be published when support is dropped, and that release will
  also document the end of support for that major version series. A longer
  support window is needed for the previous major version as this gives downstream
  consumers of Qiskit a chance to migrate not only their code but also their
  users. We do not recommended for a downstream library that
  depends on Qiskit to bump its minimum Qiskit version to a new
  major version release immediately because its user base will also need a chance
  to migrate to the new API changes. Having an extended support window
  for the previous major Qiskit version gives downstream projects time to fix
  compatibility with the next major version. Downstream projects can provide
  support for two release series at a time to give their users a migration path.

  For the purposes of semantic versioning, the Qiskit public API is considered
  any documented module, class, function, or method that is not marked as private
  (with a `_` prefix). However, there can be explicit exceptions made in the case
  of specific documented APIs. In such cases these APIs will be clearly documented
  as not being considered stable interfaces yet, and a user-visible warning will be
  actively emitted on any use of these unstable interfaces. Additionally, in some
  situations an interface marked as private will be considered part of the public
  API. Typically this only occurs in two cases: either an abstract interface
  definition where subclasses are intended to override/implement a private method
  as part of defining an implementation of the interface, or advanced-usage
  low-level methods that have stable interfaces but are not considered safe to use,
  as the burden is on the user to uphold the class/safety invariants themselves
  (the canonical example of this is the `QuantumCircuit._append` method).

  The supported Python versions, minimum supported Rust version (for building
  Qiskit from source), and any Python package dependencies (including the minimum
  supported versions of dependencies) used by Qiskit are not part of the backwards
  compatibility guarantees and may change during any release. Only minor or major
  version releases will raise minimum requirements for using or building Qiskit
  (including adding new dependencies), but patch fixes might include support for
  new versions of Python or other dependencies. Usually the minimum version of a
  dependency is only increased when older dependency versions go out of support or
  when it is not possible to maintain compatibility with the latest release of the
  dependency and the older version.

<details>
  <summary>
  Upgrade strategy
  </summary>
  Whenever a new major version is released, the recommended upgrade path
  is to first upgrade to use the most recent minor version on the previous major
  version. Shortly before a new major version, a final minor version will
  be published. This final minor version release `M.N+1.0` is equivalent to
  `M.N.0` but with warnings and deprecations for any API changes that are
  made on the new major version series.

  For example, immediately proceeding the 1.0.0 release, a 0.46.0 release will be
  published. The 0.46.0 release will be equivalent to the 0.45.0 release but with
  additional deprecation warnings that document the API changes that were made as
  part of the 1.0.0 release. This pattern will be used for any future major
  version releases.

  As a user of Qiskit, it's recommended that you first upgrade to this final minor
  version first, so you can see any deprecation warnings and adjust your Qiskit
  usage ahead of time before trying a potentially breaking release. The previous
  major version will be supported for at least six months to give sufficient time
  to upgrade. A typical pattern to manage this is to pin the max version to
  avoid using the next major release series until you're sure of compatibility.
  For example, specifying in a requirements file `qiskit<2` when the current
  major Qiskit version is 1 will ensure that you're using a version of Qiskit
  that won't have breaking API changes.

  Pre-emptively capping the version less than the next major version is necessary
  to ensure you get a chance to see deprecation warnings before a
  major version release. The normal release schedule means the last minor
  version release which includes any final deprecation warnings will be released
  shortly before the next major version and `pip` will default to using
  the newest version available unless the version cap is set.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
  Pre-releases
</summary>
  For each minor and major version release Qiskit will publish pre-releases that
  are compatible with [PEP440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). Typically
  these are release candidates of the form `X.Y.0rc1`. The `rc` releases
  will have a finalized API surface and are used to test a prospective release.

  Note that when one of the PEP440 pre-release suffixes (such as `a`, `b`, or `pre`) are
  published, it does not have the same guarantees as an `rc` release, and is
  only a preview release. The API might change between these pre-releases
  and the final release with that version number. For example, `1.0.0pre1` might have
  a different final API than `1.0.0`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
  Post-releases
</summary>
  If there are issues with the packaging of a given release, a post-release may be
  issued to correct this. These will follow the form `X.Y.Z.1` where the fourth
  integer is used to indicate it is the first post-release of the `X.Y.Z` release.
  For example, the qiskit-terra (the legacy package name for Qiskit) 0.25.2
  release had some issue with the sdist package publishing, and a post-release
  0.25.2.1 was published that corrected this issue. The code was identical, and
  0.25.2.1 only fixed the packaging issue for the release.
