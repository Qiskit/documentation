# Install Qiskit from source

Installing Qiskit from source allows you to access the current development version, instead of using the version in the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository. This lets you inspect and extend the latest version of the Qiskit code more efficiently. 

## Create and activate a new virtual environment

First, create a new virtual environment for Qiskit. 

```python
  python3 -m venv QiskitDevenv
  source QiskitDevenv/bin/activate
```

## Install the Rust compiler

A Rust compiler must be installed on your system to compile Qiskit. To install the Rust compiler, use the cross-platform Rust installer [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) or [another install method.](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html) 

## Install Qiskit

Follow these steps to install Qiskit:

1.  Clone the Qiskit repository.

```python
  git clone https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit.git
```

2.  Change to the `qiskit` directory. 

```python
  cd qiskit
```

3.  (Optional) If you want to run tests or linting checks, install the developer requirements.

```python
  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

4.  Install `qiskit`. 

-   **Standard install**: 

    ```python
      pip install .
    ```

-   **Editable mode**: In this mode, you don't need to reinstall Qiskit when there are code changes to the project.

    ```python
      pip install -e .
    ```

    In editable mode, the compiled extensions are built in _debug mode_ without optimizations. This affects the runtime performance of the compiled code. To build the compiled extensions with optimizations enabled, run the following command to rebuild the binary in _release mode_:

    ```python
      python setup.py build_rust --release --inplace
    ```

    <Admonition type="note">
    If you are working on Rust code in Qiskit, you need to rebuild the extension code every time you make a local change. In editable mode, the Rust extension is only built when the install command is run, so local changes you make to the Rust code are not reflected in the installed package unless you rebuild the extension by rerunning `build_rust` (with or without `--release`, depending on whether you want to build in release or debug mode).
