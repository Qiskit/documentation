# Get started with primitives

The steps in this topic describes how to set up  primitives, explore the options you can use to configure them, then invoke them in a program.

<Admonition type="note">
    These examples all use the primitives from Qiskit Runtime, but you could use the base primitives instead.

## Get started with Estimator

### 1.  Initialize the account

Since Qiskit Runtime `Estimator` is a managed service, you will first need to initialize your account. You can then select the simulator or real backend you want to use to calculate the expectation value.

Follow the steps in the [Install and set up topic](../start/install) if you don't already have an account.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend("ibm_brisbane")
```

### 2.  Create a circuit and an observable

Just like the section before, you will need at least one circuit and one observable as inputs to the `Estimator` primitive.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit.circuit.library import IQP
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp, random_hermitian

n_qubits = 127

mat = np.real(random_hermitian(n_qubits, seed=1234))
circuit = IQP(mat)
observable = SparsePauliOp("Z" * n_qubits)
print(f">>> Observable: {observable.paulis}")
```

### 3.  Initialize the Qiskit Runtime Estimator

Here we are initializing an instance of `qiskit_ibm_runtime.Estimator` instead of `qiskit.primitives.Estimator` to use Qiskit Runtime's implementation of the `Estimator`. 

When you initialize the `Estimator`, you'll need to pass in the backend you previously selected as the target device (or simulator).  You could also do this within the `session` parameter. 

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Estimator

estimator = Estimator(backend=backend)
```

### 4.  Invoke the Estimator and get results

You can then invoke the `run()` method to calculate expectation values for the input circuits and observables.

```python
job = estimator.run(circuit, observable)
print(f">>> Job ID: {job.job_id()}")
print(f">>> Job Status: {job.status()}")
```

```python
result = job.result()
print(f">>> {result}")
print(f"  > Expectation value: {result.values[0]}")
print(f"  > Metadata: {result.metadata[0]}")
```

<span id="start-sampler"></span>
## Get started with Sampler

### 1.  Initialize the account

Since Qiskit Runtime `Sampler` is a managed service, you will first need to initialize your account. You can then select the simulator or real backend you want to use to calculate the expectation value.

Follow the steps in the [Install and set up topic](../start/install) if you don't already have an account set up.

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.backend("ibm_brisbane")
```

### 2.  Create a circuit

Just like the section before, you will need at least one circuit as the input to the `Sampler` primitive.

```python
import numpy as np
from qiskit.circuit.library import IQP
from qiskit.quantum_info import random_hermitian

n_qubits = 127

mat = np.real(random_hermitian(n_qubits, seed=1234))
circuit = IQP(mat)
circuit.measure_all()
```

### 3.  Initialize the Qiskit Runtime Sampler

Here we are initializing an instance of `qiskit_ibm_runtime.Sampler` instead of `qiskit.primitives.Sampler` to use Qiskit Runtime's implementation of the `Sampler`. 

When you initialize the `Sampler`, you'll need to pass in the backend you previously selected as the target device (or simulator).  You could also do this within the `session` parameter. 

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import Sampler

sampler = Sampler(backend=backend)
```

### 4.  Invoke the Sampler and get results

You can then invoke the `run()` method to generate a quasi-probability distribution for the input circuits and quantum states.

```python
job = sampler.run(circuit)
print(f">>> Job ID: {job.job_id()}")
print(f">>> Job Status: {job.status()}")
```

```python
result = job.result()
print(f">>> {result}")
print(f"  > Quasi-probability distribution: {result.quasi_dists[0]}")
print(f"  > Metadata: {result.metadata[0]}")
```
