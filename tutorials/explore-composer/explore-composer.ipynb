Indeed, like the [phase disk](#phase-disk), the Bloch sphere gives a *local* view of the quantum state, where each qubit is viewed on its own. When trying to understand how registers of qubits (multi-qubit states) behave upon the application of quantum circuits, it is more insightful to take a *global* view and look at the quantum state in its entirety. The q-sphere provides a visual representation of the quantum state, and thus this *global* viewpoint. Therefore, when exploring quantum applications and algorithms on small numbers of qubits, the q-sphere should be the primary visualization method.\n",
