This is also sometimes called **quantum-resistant**, or **post-quantum cryptography**.`\n",

This class consists of decision problems for which proposed solutions can be verified in polynomial time using a <DefinitionTooltip definition=\"Machine that operates on an infinite tape containing symbols which has a read/write head that can move left or right on the tape and change the symbols according to a set of predetermined rules.

This means that for any given configuration of the machine, there is only one possible next step.\">deterministic Turing machine</DefinitionTooltip> (DTM). The importance of NP stems from the fact that it is conjectured to consist of many computational problems that cannot be solved efficiently by both classical and quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first generation of successful asymmetric key cryptosystems developed in the 1970s based their security on mathematical problems such as prime factorization and discrete logarithms that are now conjectured to belong to the **NP-intermediate** subclass of NP. This subclass consists of problems that are believed not to have polynomial-time solutions on DTMs but at the same time are also not as hard as the hardest problems in NP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter belong to the subclass [**NP-complete**](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NP-completeness&oldid=1157123934). Following [Shor's algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1994.365700) in the 1990s, it became clear that at least some NP-intermediate problems are amenable to efficient solutions on quantum computers that are not DTMs.\n",

    "\n",
    "While there are many known NP-hard problems, not every such problem is suitable as a basis for cryptographic security. In this context, the notion of [**average-case hardness**](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computational_hardness_assumption&oldid=1158033193) is useful for cryptography. A problem is **average-case hard** if most instances of the problem drawn randomly from some distribution are hard, whereas a problem is **worst-case hard** if it is hard only on some isolated *worst-case* instances. Quantum-safe cryptologists therefore search for mathematical problems that satisfy the assumption of average-case hardness and employ theoretical tools such as worst-case to average-case [reductions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08125) to identify suitable protocols whose security and efficiency can be guaranteed."

    "2. [**Code-based cryptography:**](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88702-7_4) This type of cryptography is based on the difficulty of decoding a general linear code.

    "3. [**Multivariate cryptography:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Multivariate_cryptography&oldid=1117344303) These systems involve equations of multiple variables over a finite field. A well-known system in this category is the HFE (Hidden Field Equations) scheme.\n",

    "4. [**Hash-based cryptography:**](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hash-based_cryptography&oldid=1159153101) These are cryptographic systems that use only cryptographic hash functions. They are often used for digital signatures, like the Merkle signature scheme.\n",

Hence, lattices serve as the foundational mathematical framework that dictates the unique traits of different structures which we use in cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple mathematical terms, a lattice can be thought of as a collection of regularly spaced points that repeat at fixed intervals.

    "Imagine you have a box of toy construction bricks, and you want to build various objects with the same set of pieces. Each unique object you create requires a specific arrangement, and the way you choose and arrange the bricks serves as the *basis* for constructing different objects. If you change the selection or arrangement of bricks, you get a different object with distinct characteristics.\n",

    "###  IND-CPA and IND-CCA security in lattice-based cryptography\n",
    "In the lesson on Symmetric Key Cryptography, we introduced the notion of **semantic security** or **IND-CPA** security which refers to [**indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack**](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ciphertext_indistinguishability&oldid=1130147047).\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional cryptosystems whether symmetric (such as AES) or asymmetric (such as RSA) use deterministic functions to implement encryption operations. This means that a given plaintext, combined with a given encryption key will always encrypt to the same ciphertext. Such deterministic cryptosystems are vulnerable to *chosen plaintext attack* whereby an adversary is able to extract information by requesting encryptions of arbitrary plaintexts of their choice from the deterministic encryption function.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve IND-CPA security in this context, **additional randomness** is introduced at encryption time either through *initialization vectors* or *padding*. For instance AES is only IND-CPA secure when used in [Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) or Gaolis/Counter Mode (GCM) modes of operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Block_cipher_mode_of_operation&oldid=1154901199#cite_note-23) that use random initialization vectors. Similarly with RSA, [OAEP padding](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Optimal_asymmetric_encryption_padding&oldid=1163481577) is need to ensure IND-CPA security.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, lattice-based schemes for encryption are inherently randomized due to the problem definition itself. In particular, in the LWE based encryption scheme outlined above, there are two distinct elements of randomness:\n",
    "- **(1)** The error (or noise) $\\varepsilon$ drawn from the distribution $\\chi$\n",
    "- **(2)** The random binary vectors $\\mathbf{r} \\in \\{0,1\\}^N$ used for encrypting each bit in the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The errors $\\varepsilon$ contribute to the security of the public key, ensuring that it's computationally hard to deduce the secret key $\\mathbf{s}$. The random binary vectors $\\mathbf{r}$ on the other hand provide the essential randomness needed for making repeated encryptions of the same plaintext bit non-deterministic. Thus LWE based schemes are considered IND-CPA secure without the need for external mechanisms such as padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern cryptosystems aim to achieve so called [**IND-CCA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ciphertext_indistinguishability&oldid=1130147047) security which stands for **indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attack**. In this setting the adversary has the ability to obtain decryptions of a non-trival set of ciphertexts of their choosing with the aim of extracting information to subsequently break the cryptosystem. A scheme is IND-CCA secure if, even with this capability, the adversary cannot do better than random guessing when trying to distinguish encrypted messages. IND-CCA is a stronger security notion than IND-CPA and subsumes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum safe KEMs such as **Kyber** are designed to be IND-CCA secure. This is achieved in two steps:\n",
    "1. An IND-CPA secure public key encryption(PKE) scheme is defined. In the case of Kyber such a PKE is based on **Module-LWE**.\n",
    "2. A variant of the [Fujisaki-Okamoto transform](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00145-011-9114-1) (FO) is applied to obtain a CCA-secure KEM. The FO transformation is a generic method to convert encryption schemes that are IND-CPA secure into ones that are IND-CCA secure. For details we refer readers to the [original papers](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00145-011-9114-1).\n",
    "\n",

    "Hybrid cryptography refers to using quantum-safe public-key algorithms are combined with traditional public key algorithms (like RSA or elliptic curves) such that the solution is at least no less secure than existing traditional cryptography.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can help address 2 issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Existing standards may mandate specific algorithms to be used for encryption, or that such algorithms are in some way approved. To add quantum safety, encryption could first be done using the regular algorithm, but then further protected by a quantum-safe algorithm, whilst still meeting required standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Quantum algorithms are new, and further analysis is needed to ensure they are indeed safe and correct. For example one of the initial algorithms shortlisted by NIST was subsequently cracked and proven to be insecure. To mitigate this risk, encryption can be done both using a standard, well-reviewed, secure (apart from quantum!) algorithm, in addition to a post-quantum algorithm."

    "## Summary\n",
    "The migration to quantum-safe cryptography (QSC) of asymmetric key cryptosystems is necessitated by the expected advent of quantum computers that can break traditional asymmetric key algorithms predicated on the classical hardness of NP-intermediate problems. QSC is conjectured to be robust to quantum attacks because its security is based on NP-hard problems, which generally cannot be efficiently solved even with quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, hard problems rooted in the theory of mathematical lattices such as the learning with errors (LWE) problem have emerged as leading contenders for QSC standardization. In particular, the CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithms, based on modular lattices, are well positioned as near-term alternatives to popular asymmetric key protocols like RSA, Elliptic Curve, Diffie-Hellman, and DSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we navigate the complex landscape of quantum-safe cryptography, embracing these innovative solutions will be pivotal in upholding the integrity and confidentiality of our digital interactions in the quantum era."
