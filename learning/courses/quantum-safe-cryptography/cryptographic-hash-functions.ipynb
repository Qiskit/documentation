    "[Hash functions][42] represent a valuable construct in cryptography as they help enable validation with confidentiality. As such, hash functions form an important component of mechanisms for data authentication and integrity, such as [hash-based message authentication codes][48] (HMAC) and [digital signatures][49]. This article will discuss the basic ideas and security considerations underpinning cryptographic hash functions and outline potential vulnerabilities from the advent of quantum computing.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are many situations where authentication and integrity verification need to be performed cheaply and without revealing private information to the party performing the validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when downloading software from a remote server, an efficient mechanism is needed to verify that the software actually downloaded has not been modified since being created by the original author of the software. Similarly, when authenticating users of web applications, it would be desirable to use a mechanism that does not involve physically storing or transmitting the actual passwords, which can potentially compromise their confidentiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Cryptographic hash functions* (CHFs) address such needs efficiently and securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, a cryptographic hash function takes an input (or *message*) of arbitrary length and returns a fixed-size string of n-bits as output. The output of a [CHF][CHF] is also referred to as a *digest*.\n",

    "A useful CHF should satisfy several key properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Uniformity:** The digests produced by a CHF should be distributed uniformly and should look random. The aim is to ensure the output leaks no information about the input.\n",
    "2. **Determinism:** For a given input, a CHF must always produce the same [digest][digest], i.e., it must be deterministic.\n",
    "3. **Irreversibility:** A CHF is a [*one-way function*][onewayfn] in that, given a digest, it should be infeasible to invert the hashing and obtain the input.\n",
    "4. **Approximate injectivity:** While CHFs are many-to-one functions, they should appear to look like one-to one functions. This is achieved by combining an enormous output space size with the avalanche effect whereby tiny changes in the input lead to wildly divergent digests.  This characteristic is known as approximate injectivity.\n",

    "Given this, it's possible to validate a piece of data against the original instance by comparing a digest of the data to a digest of the original.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cryptographic hash functions are an essential component for ensuring data integrity and privacy in digital information systems and find widespread application in many contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The security requirements of CHFs are mainly understood in terms of their resistance to pre-image and collision attacks. For well-designed CHFs, the hash length is a good proxy for the security level.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the advent of quantum computers executing the Grover and BHT algorithms in theory affects the pre-image and collision resistance of traditional CHFs, the long hash lengths already in use today means that modern cryptographic hashing algorithms, such as SHA-3, are likely to remain secure barring the discovery of as-yet-unknown cryptanalytic attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevance of CHFs lies in their role as a fundamental building block for quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes, ensuring that digital information remains secure even in the face of potential future advancements in quantum computing algorithms and technologies."
