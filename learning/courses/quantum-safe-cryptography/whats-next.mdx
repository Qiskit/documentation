# What's next?

Now that you’ve learned the fundamentals of quantum-safe cryptography, explore the technologies IBM Quantum&reg; offers for modernizing your cryptographic landscape and building quantum cyber resilience. [IBM Quantum Safe&trade;](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/quantum-safe) is a comprehensive set of tools, capabilities, and approaches combined with deep expertise to help you plan and execute your organization’s migration to quantum-safe cryptography. Discover, observe, and transform your cryptography with three core technical capabilities:

**1. IBM Quantum Safe Explorer**

IBM Quantum Safe Explorer simplifies the discovery and management of cryptography by performing source code and object code scanning to identify all cryptographically relevant artifacts, uncover dependencies, and surface vulnerabilities. Explorer represents this data in a [Cryptography Bill of Materials](https://github.com/IBM/CBOM) (CBOM), a common extension to the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) that systematizes the creation and sharing of metadata describing cryptographic artifacts.

**2. IBM Quantum Safe Advisor**

IBM Quantum Safe Advisor complements the static code analysis from IBM Quantum Safe Explorer with a dynamic, runtime perspective of your cryptographic posture and compliance. Advisor correlates [CBOMs][CBOM] and aggregates data from network and endpoint scans to build a comprehensive cryptographic inventory. This inventory details:

- The types and locations of your cryptographic instances
- Associated certificates, cipher suites, and CBOMs
- The relationships between assets and data flows
- Potential vulnerabilities to quantum technology

With its policy-based enrichment, Advisor equips you to evaluate your cryptography and data compliance and generate a prioritized list of vulnerabilities so that you can establish a quantum-safe remediation strategy.

**3. IBM Quantum Safe Remediator**

IBM Quantum Safe Remediator enables you to apply best practices for quantum-safe remediation patterns focused on VPN communication, TLS communication, and cluster access communication. Build crypto-agility by exploring solutions for transforming your cryptography without disrupting business operations.
