    "\n",
    "As we learned in the last lesson, symmetric key cryptography is very fast and efficient for protecting information, but it has a few limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As the number of parties wishing to exchange secure information increases, the numbers of keys required grows combinatorially. It provides no mechanism to securely distribute these keys between senders and receivers.\n",
    "2. There is no provision for [*non-repudiation*][nonrepudiation]. Any party is able to decrypt, or encrypt, messages with no way to guarantee a message was received or where it originated\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to both these problems is provided by *asymmetric key cryptography* (AKC), also known as [*public key cryptography*][59] (PKC), which therefore forms a cornerstone of modern digital security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymmetric key cryptography (AKC) involves the use of a pair of keys – one public, one private. The public and private keys are cryptographically linked and typically generated at the same time as a *key pair* using a specialized mathematical algorithm. The public key, as suggested by its name, is then meant to be freely distributed, while the private key is kept secret by the party generating the key pair. Security of communications employing asymmetric key pairs is assured as long as the private key remains confidential.\n",

DH employs the principles of modular arithmetic to ensure both parties end up with the same shared secret even though each party has access only to the other party's public key.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike key exchange protocols like DH and ECDH, which are interactive, requiring back-and-forth communication to decide the symmetric key, AKC also provides for non-interactive ways to establish a shared secret key. In such schemes, one party generates a pair of keys (public and private) and shares the public key with the other party. This second party then generates a random symmetric key, encrypts it with the received public key, and sends it back to the first party. The first party uses their private key to decrypt the received message, thereby obtaining the shared symmetric key. This scheme is non-interactive in that the symmetric key is determined by one party and simply communicated securely to the other party in encrypted form.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important consideration in non-interactive key exchange has to do with the length differential in bits between the symmetric key the parties wish to exchange and recommended message sizes in AKC. Typically, modern symmetric keys are in the range of 128-256 bits long, while asymmetric key cryptosystems such as RSA work with message sizes around 1024-4096 bits long. Therefore, when using AKC to transmit a symmetric key, for security it must nevertheless be encoded into a longer 1024-4096 bit message. This can be achieved via two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Padding-based key exchange:** In this approach, the shorter (128-256 bit) symmetric key is generated first and then an agreed-upon reversible padding scheme such as [OAEP][71] is used to embed it into a longer (1024-4096 bit) message.

    "[*Digital signatures*][49] are another powerful application of asymmetric key cryptography. They provide authentication, integrity, and nonrepudiation enabled by the fact that within AKC, entities possess unique private keys. The basic idea underlying signature protocols is that senders of secure messages will additionally *digitally sign* the messages using their unique private key. The receiver will then verify the digital signature using the public key of the sender. Within AKC, digital signatures can be implemented by using algorithms specifically designed for that purpose or by using generic cryptosystems.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Secure shell (SSH):** SSH is a protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network. It uses asymmetric key cryptography to authenticate the server to the client and, optionally, the client to the server.\n",

    "## Security of asymmetric key cryptography\n",
    "\n",
    "Several cryptographic notions come together to enable secure asymmetric key cryptography, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private key secrecy**: The most basic security requirement of AKC is that the private key remains secret. However, since the private key must be mathematically linked to the public key, private key secrecy also requires that it be computationally infeasible to derive the private key from knowledge of the public key. Key generation schemes within AKC rely on computationally hard mathematical problems to facilitate this requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trapdoor functionality** In AKC, the encryption and decryption operations involve different complementary keys from a single-key pair. Ciphertext generated by encryption using one of the keys (for example the public key) must be inscrutable to third parties while being easily decryptable by the holder of the complementary key (in this case the private key). In other words, encryption should resemble a [*trapdoor one-way function*][67] such that third parties cannot invert the operation and recover the plain text but the private key provides a secret *trapdoor* that enables easy inversion. Popular AKC algorithms use modular exponentiation to set up trapdoor one-way function behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomness**: The key generation process should also exploit randomness to ensure that keys are unpredictable, as any pattern or predictability in key generation could be exploited by an attacker. Randomness is also used for padding during encryption to generate semantically secure ciphertexts and within digital signature schemes to produce unique signatures even when the same message is signed multiple times. For this reason, the use of strong random number generators is an important part of AKC.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large key size**: As in the case of SKC, large key sizes ensure protection against brute force attacks. However, since large key sizes also increase the computational cost of the encryption and decryption process, an optimal solution needs to balance security and efficiency considerations. The following table shows typical key sizes for various asymmetric key cryptography protocols and applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Protocol | Typical Key Sizes (in bits)         | Application                    |\n",
    "|----------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n",
    "| RSA      | 1024 (deprecated), 2048, 3072, 4096 | Encryption, digital signatures |\n",
    "| DSA      | 1024 (deprecated), 2048, 3072       | Digital signatures             |\n",
    "| DH       | 2048, 3072, 4096                    | Key exchange                   |\n",
    "| ECDH     | 224, 256, 384, 521                  | Key exchange                   |\n",

    "\n",
    "**Public key infrastructure**: In AKC, the private keys must be kept secret by the owners while the public keys are shared. There needs to be a secure mechanism to manage and distribute these public keys between users. *Public key infrastructure* (PKI) provides a way to do this using *digital certificates*. A digital certificate provides proof of identity of the owner of the public key and is issued by a trusted authority like a certificate authority(which is part of a PKI). Hence, PKI plays an integral part in the security of modern application using AKC by enabling large-scale key management (by creating, managing, distributing and revoking digital certificates).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security risks to asymmetric key cryptography\n",
    "As outlined in the above table, modern asymmetric key algorithms such as RSA typically employ much larger key sizes than commonly used symmetric key counterparts such as AES-128. Even the ECC-based protocols (ECDH and ECDSA) that have smaller key sizes employ a minimum of at least 224 bits for keys. This in turn implies that a brute force attack involving an exhaustive search of the private key space to identify the correct key is computationally intractable in the foreseeable future. This remains true even if quantum computers were to be deployed for this task. Therefore, attacks against AKC usually focus on exploiting other potential weaknesses of specific cryptosystems. Some well-documented attack modes target:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Algorithmic weakness** by using sophisticated mathematical and computational means to undermine the hardness assumptions used to formulate asymmetric key algorithms. For example, the security of RSA is predicated on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, and recent computational advances have [enabled successful factoring of 829-bit RSA keys][68]. Therefore, 1024-bit RSA is currently deprecated. As will be discussed later, the primary risk posed by quantum computers to AKC also falls into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Imperfect randomness**, which can lead to weakness in the key generation process. For example, if the random number generator used to create the keys is flawed and generates keys that are not truly random, an attacker might be able to predict the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Implementation flaws** such as errors in the implementation of cryptographic algorithms that inadvertently reveal information about the keys. For example, incorrect padding can potentially reveal details about keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Side channels** that refer to information leakage from the physical system that performs the cryptography. Such leaks could be in the form of timing information, power consumption, or even sound, which can be exploited in a so-called [*side-channel attack*][69]. For example, analyzing how long cryptographic operations take to execute could reveal the number of '1's in a binary key. This seemingly innocent leakage significantly narrows the search space, unveiling potential solutions to problems that initially seemed insurmountable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Key exchange** by intercepting keys while they are being exchanged, such as within a [*man-in-the-middle* attack][70] (MITM). The DH protocol is susceptible to MITM attacks if additional authentication steps are not incorporated.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Key storage** by aiming to steal keys from poorly secured storage. This includes physical attacks such as manipulation or theft of storage devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Securing asymmetric key cryptosystems against the variety of attacks that are possible is therefore a significant task involving mathematical, hardware, software, logistical, and legal considerations.\n",

    "With classical computing, the security of the DSA can be influenced by several factors:\n",

    "1. **Key size**: As always, key size provides basic protection against brute force attacks. Modern applications that use DSA use key sizes of at least 2048 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quality of $k$**: In DSA, each signature needs a unique, random, and secret $k$ value (see above). The uniqueness, entropy, and secrecy of $k$ are critical, and weakness in any of these aspects could lead to the private key $x$ being compromised. The random number generators used for generating $k$ need to be secure themselves.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we started by looking at the main characteristics of asymmetric key cryptography (AKC) and discussed basic security considerations that underpin asymmetric cryptosystems. In particular, we introduced the two main applications of AKC — namely, key exchange and digital signatures — both of which are essential components of modern internet-based communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then looked at the RSA cryptosystem, which since the 1970s, has proven to be of immense value for securing modern digital communications by enabling key exchange and digital signatures within a simple and versatile framework. The cryptographic security of RSA with respect to classical computing is based on the hardness of factoring large integers and requires key sizes in the range of 2048 bits to assure the integers used in practical applications are large enough to resist factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then looked at Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange and the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). The security of these schemes is predicated on the integer discrete logarithm (DLP) problem, the private key being computationally hard to extract given the public key, with no polynomial time solution on classical computers. Use of random and unique keys affords additional security against attacks. Both the integer finite field and elliptic curve variants of the DH and DSA protocols currently find widespread use across many modern digital communications protocols such as [*TLS*][127], [*SSH*][81], and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we looked at Elliptic curve cryptography. With its efficient key size and strong security properties, it currently represents an excellent choice for many cryptographic applications, from key exchange to digital signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these algorithms have exposure to attack from quantum algorithms, since solutions can be developed to solve the mathematical problems which acted as a premise in their design. One such example is Shor's algorithm. Therefore they will need to be replaced by quantum-safe asymmetric cryptosystems which are more resilient to attack from quantum - as well as being as safe with classical algorithms. The mathematical problems they rely on can be solved efficiently by quantum computers, necessitating the development of quantum-safe asymmetric cryptosystems that can withstand quantum attacks while maintaining classical security.\n",
    "\n",
    "A future lesson will look at quantum-safe cryptosystems and discuss the required approach to maintain cryptographic security.\n",
