# Overview

!["Hero image"](/learning/images/courses/quantum-safe-cryptography/Quantum-Safe-Cryptography_V1_Illustration.svg)


A practical introduction to quantum-safe cryptography is a free online course in  IBM Quantum&reg; Learning and serves as a primer on the foundational concepts in quantum-safe cryptography.

This course was created for developers who are interested in modernizing their application security and features multimodal lessons and interactive live code examples in four core areas of cryptography: cryptographic hash functions, symmetric key cryptography, asymmetric key cryptography, and quantum-safe cryptography.

By taking this course, developers will learn how the cybersecurity risk landscape is evolving as well as explore contemporary approaches poised to shape the quantum era.
