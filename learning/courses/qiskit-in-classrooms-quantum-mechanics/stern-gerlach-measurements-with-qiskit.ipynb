    "## The experiment\n",
    "In the early 1900's, evidence of quantized behavior on atomic scales was mounting. Many successful interpretations of data like Max Planck's explanation of the ultraviolet catastrophe, and experiments like the one by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach were critical in convincing the world that a system of quantum mechanics was necessary, and that certain physical phenomena are quantized. In the case of the Stern-Gerlach experiment (conceived by Stern in 1921 and carried out by Stern and Gerlach in 1922), the goal was to check for the quantization of angular momentum in atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around that same time a prevalent model for the atom was Bohr-Sommerfeld model, which was an extension to the Bohr model, and like the Bohr model, it predicted that electrons existing in certain quantized orbits similar to planets orbiting the sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of Bohr-Sommerfeld model. A central dot represents the nucleus of an atom. Circles or ellipses around that point represent atomic orbitals, looking very much like planetary orbits around the sun. Higher-energy orbits are farther from the nucleus.](/learning/images/courses/qiskit-in-classrooms-quantum-mechanics/stern-gerlach-measurements-with-qiskit/sg-orbitals.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ultimately this treatment would turn out to be insufficient to explain quantum mechanical behavior of the atom, broadly, it did predict many observed phenomenon, like the discrete spectral lines of atoms. The quantized orbits of electrons with specific energies corresponds to quantized values of angular momentum. It is this orbital angular momentum that Stern and Gerlach sought to observe in their experiment, though the experiment applies to any type of quantized angular momentum, including spin. You may often hear of the Stern-Gerlach experiment applied to spins. The focus of the original experiment was on orbital angular momentum simply because George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit would not theorize the existence of spin until 1925.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the type of angular momentum, a charge with angular momentum has a magnetic moment. In the classical treatment of orbital motion, one would expect a particle of charge $q$, mass $m$ and angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ to have a magnetic moment $\\mu$ given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\mu} = \\frac{q}{2m}\\vec{L}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that almost the same formula holds for quantum mechanical angular momentum, with the caveat of adding a numerical ratio related to the type of angular momentum, called the g-factor $g$. When combining different types of angular momentum, or generalizing to an arbitrary type, one often sees $\\vec{J}$ used instead of $\\vec{L}$, so we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\mu} = \\frac{gq}{2m}\\vec{J}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For classical objects $g=1$. For electrons, $g\\approx 2$, and there are many values for various nuclei and subatomic particles. The main point here is that quantized angular momentum means a quantized magnetic moment!\n",
    "\n",
    "This magnetic momentum will experience a torque in a magnetic field:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{\\tau}=\\vec{\\mu}\\times \\vec{B}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And it will experience a force in a magnetic field with a non-zero gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F} = \\nabla(\\vec{\\mu}\\cdot\\vec{B})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will often consider the above expression one component at a time, so it may be convenient to think of its $z$-component:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_z = \\mu_z \\frac{dB_z}{dz}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining expressions, we can obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_z = \\frac{gq}{2m} \\frac{dB_z}{dz} J_z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Stern and Gerlach did not know about the $g$ factor, but even with it in the expression, we have a force equal to several known or measurable constants times an angular momentum. So using a magnetic field with a known gradient, and measuring the deflection of a particle as it passes through the field, we should get information about the angular momentum. This is the crux of the Stern Gerlach experiment.\n",

Classically, we would expect a continuous distribution on the screen, but in the experiment we see two distinct points.](/learning/images/courses/qiskit-in-classrooms-quantum-mechanics/stern-gerlach-measurements-with-qiskit/sg-device.avif)\n",

    "Fig. Stern–Gerlach experiment[1]: Silver atoms travelling through an inhomogeneous magnetic field, and being deflected up or down depending on their spin. Classically, we would expect a continuous distribution on the screen, but in the experiment we see two distinct points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neutral silver atoms were heated in an oven. As a beam of silver atoms streamed from the oven, beam collimators were used to select only atoms travelling near the center of the inhomogeneous magnetic field. Of course, some atoms deviate a bit to the left or right, and experience a weaker gradient in the field, or no gradient at all. So, we are not overly concerned with the behavior of atoms far to the left or right. We are interested in what happens to the atoms that travel down the center of the channel, where the magnetic field gradient will yield a force deflecting the atoms in the $z$-direction only.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What should we expect, classically?\n",
    "\n",
    "How would these atoms behave if they were exactly like bulky, classical magnets? You can do the experiment. Imagine firing tiny neodymium magnets past a large, powerful magnet. The orientation of the tiny magnets is random. But as they pass the large magnet, they quickly re-orient themselves to align with the field, and become attracted to the large magnet. The vast majority of tiny magnets are deflected toward the large magnet. The very astute observer might question, \"What about energy conservation?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, a magnetic moment in an external magnetic field has a potential energy associated with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U = -\\vec{\\mu}\\cdot \\vec{B} = -\\mu B \\cos(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if a magnetic moment were to rotate in the external magnetic field, there would be a change in energy given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U = U_f - U_i = -\\mu B (\\cos(\\theta_f) - \\cos(\\theta_i)).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the special case of a small magnet perfectly anti-aligned with the external field flipping over and aligning with it, this would correspond to a decrease in potential energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta U = U_f - U_i = -\\mu B (\\cos(0) - \\cos(\\pi)) = -2\\mu B.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So where does that energy go? A classical magnet like a small neodymium refrigerator magnet has many particles and can dissipate almost any quantity of energy as heat. The initial and final angles between the magnetic moment and the external magnetic field could be anything, and at least the initial orientation would be random. So a different amount of energy would be dissipated as heat for each tiny magnet. But classically this is no problem, since an ensemble of classical particles can dissipate any amount of energy as heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What should we expect applying classical thinking to atomic scales?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very least this is not the same for atomic-scale magnets, because there are fewer particles in play, fewer degrees of freedom through which energy may be dissipated. The proposals of early quantum mechanics suggested further that the energy that can be absorbed by an individual particle, such as the electron, would be quantized, meaning an electron could only absorb a few specific amounts of energy. Since the random initial orientations would require the dissipation of random amounts of energy, this should not be possible for a system with quantized energy levels. The excess energy could not be dissipated as heat. So what would happen instead?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check-in question\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain what you think would happen in a situation like that described above. That is, you have an atomically small magnet that cannot dissipate any energy as heat. So, any initial magnetic potential energy must remain in the system. Yet, a torque is applied by an external magnetic field, which attempts to rotate the small magnet to align with the external field. What happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Answer:</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "The tiny magnetic moment would rotate toward alignment with the external field. But when it momentarily aligns, it would have rotational kinetic energy that would keep it rotating past the field and back out of alignment. This behavior can even be seen in large classical magnets. But in those classical systems, the oscillation of the small magnetic moment eventually stops as energy is dissipated into heat. But in a system with no such dissipative mechanism, the oscillation should continue indefinitely.\n",

    "Perhaps the strangest of all possibilities would be the following: What if the angular momentum of the electron were quantized, but also its projection on some axis were also quantized? The quantization of angular momentum as a magnitude is interesting, but one might try to argue through it using classical intuition, the way planetary orbits settled into fixed paths that don't cross each other, having only certain allowed angular momenta. But what if that angular momentum vector could only point exactly along $z$ or exactly opposite $z$, but not have any other component along $z$? What if then when measured along a different direction, the vector could only point entirely along $x$ or entirely opposite $x$, and nothing in between? That would be strange in a way that confounds all classical intuition.\n",

    "What sort of distribution of particles on a screen would you expect to find in this last case, where the projection of angular momentum along the direction of the field is quantized?

    "The particles in the center of the device would experience a single inhomogeneous field and would all be measured to have one of two orientations to their magnetic moments. So, they would either be deflected maximally with the gradient or maximally against the gradient, and nothing in between. Of course, off to either side, where the gradient is weaker, the deflection would be smaller. At very large lateral positions, they may be entirely outside the gradient, and there could be just a single region of undeflected particles.\n",

    "Most quantum computers use \"qubits\" - the quantum analogs of classical bits. More specifically, they are designed to be two-level systems, analogous to the \"on\"/\"off\" states of classical bits. Quantum computing paradigms do exist which make use of three-level systems (so called \"qutrits\") or many-level systems (called \"qudits\"). But most work is concentrated on qubits. In particular, IBM Quantum Computers use what are called fixed-frequency transmon qubits. These are quite a bit different from orbital or spin angular momentum of atoms. But like the spin of an electron, IBM qubits are quantum mechanical systems that can interact with light and on which measurements can be made. In fact, one often finds analogies made between states of quantum mechanical spin and computational states of a qubit. For example, one often sees the \"spin-up\" state associated with the computational 0 state, and \"spin-down\" associated with the computational 1 state:\n",

But what happens to the qubit's state (or the particle's angular momentum) after the measurement? To answer that, we'll need to define a circuit that allows us to make multiple measurements of the same qubits. Let us define a circuit that we can use to investigate this. We will want to allow for the possibility of measuring both states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, so we need something to rotate the qubit's initial state away from the default $|0\\rangle$ state. In this case, we will use a hadamard gate $H$, since $H|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)$. Note that, by default, both of these measurements will be along $z$."

That is, if we obtain the 0 state once, when we measure again it is still in the 0 state (up to some minor noise in the system ~0.1% to 1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take explicit notice that we have not yet addressed the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, nor said anything about \"collapsing\" the state to an eigenstate. Using only the observations above, it might be tempting to look for a mathematical operation $O$ that leaves some special set of quantum mechanical states $|\\psi\\rangle$ unchanged up to perhaps a constant: $O|\\psi\\rangle = c|\\psi \\rangle$, since measuring along $z$ twice yields the same result. Ultimately, that search will fail to describe all the behaviors we will see. But it can describe some things, so we will pursue it a bit longer.\n",

It is not at all obvious what values should go into such a matrix or state vector, but the only property we have from the measurements so far that we could use to label states would be the probability of measuring 0 or 1 (\"spin-up\" or \"spin-down\" in the context of spin-1/2 particles). We should consider that the entries in the state vectors should be related to this probability (exactly the probability, \"probability amplitude\" - meaning we square the entry to obtain the probability, etc.). But at this point, we're not sure if the entries in these matrices should be strictly real, complex, or what. To be safe, let's attempt to develop a framework in which the vectors and matrices satisfy the following:\n",

Another key connection to the experiment is that from the deflection amount, travel time, and known magnetic field strength, we can determine the magnitude of the $z$ component of spin.

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For spin-1/2 particle, a measurement of the projection of spin on some axis can only yield one of two outcomes, often called \"up\" and \"down\".\n",
    "- Qubits can only be measured in one of two states, often referred to as $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "- We can model the Stern Gerlach experiment on spin-1/2 particles using qubits in a quantum computer.\n",
    "- Repeated measurements of the same physical observable of the same particle/qubit will yield the same result (unless the system is perturbed by noise).\n",
    "- We can use results from the Stern Gerlach experiment or from the analogous experiments with quantum computers to derive a system of state vectors and matrix operators that describe quantum mechanical spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### T/F questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T/F Starting from experimental observations, the only valid choice for a vector to represent $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "2. T/F If $|\\uparrow\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$, the only choice for $|\\downarrow\\rangle$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$ (up to a global phase).\n",
    "3. T/F A particle measured to be in the state $|0\\rangle$ will continue to be found in the state $|0\\rangle$ upon subsequent measurements along $z$.\n",
    "4. T/F A particle measured to be in the state $|0\\rangle$ will continue to be found in the state $|0\\rangle$ upon subsequent measurements along $x$.\n",
    "5. T/F A particle measured to be in the state $|0\\rangle$ will always be found in the state $|+\\rangle_x$ upon subsequent measurements along $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MC questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A particle initially in $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ has what probability of being measured in the state $|+x\\rangle$?\n",
    "    - a. 0%\n",
    "    - b. 25%\n",
    "    - c. 50%\n",
    "    - d. 71%\n",
    "    - e. 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A particle initially in $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ has what probability of being measured in the state $|\\downarrow\\rangle$?\n",
    "    - a. 0%\n",
    "    - b. 25%\n",
    "    - c. 50%\n",
    "    - d. 71%\n",
    "    - e. 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The state $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ of a spin-1/2 particle is most commonly associated with what quantum computing state?\n",
    "    - a. $|+\\rangle$\n",
    "    - b. $|-\\rangle$\n",
    "    - c. $|0\\rangle$\n",
    "    - d. $|1\\rangle$\n",
    "    - e. None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Three friends are discussing quantum measurements and operators. Friend A says, \"Making a measurement along $z$ and acting with the operator $\\sigma_z$ are the same thing.\" Friend B says, \"Well, they are different procedures, but they have the same result.\" Friend C says, \"They are totally different; they even have different effects on most states.\" With whom do you agree and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free response problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given the experimental observations and proposed syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{\\uparrow+x}=\\vert \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b\\end{pmatrix}\\vert^2 = |a|^2 =\\frac{1}{2} $$\n",
    "$$P_{\\downarrow+x}=\\vert \\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b\\end{pmatrix}\\vert^2 = |b|^2 =\\frac{1}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "show that up to a global phase\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|+\\rangle_x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ e^{i\\alpha}\\end{pmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose $\\alpha = 0$ to obtain the standard result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given the experimental observations and proposed syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{\\uparrow-x}=\\vert \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}a \\\\ b\\end{pmatrix}\\vert^2 = |a|^2 =\\frac{1}{2} $$\n",

    "And using the result from challenge problem 3:\n",
