    "## Classical linear codes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical error correcting codes were first studied in the 1940s, and many different codes are now known, with the most commonly studied and used codes falling into a category of codes known as *linear codes.*\n",
    "We'll see exactly what the word \"linear\" means in this context in just a moment, but a very simple way to express what linear codes are at this point is that they're stabilizer codes that happen to be classical.\n",
    "CSS codes are essentially *pairs* of classical linear codes that are combined together to create a quantum error correcting code.\n",
    "So, for the sake of the discussion that follows, we're going to need to understand a few basic things about classical linear codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\Sigma$ be the binary alphabet for this entire discussion.\n",
    "When we refer to a *classical linear code*, we mean a non-empty set $\\mathcal{C}\\subseteq\\Sigma^n$ of binary strings of length $n,$ for some positive integer $n,$ which must satisfy just one basic property:\n",
    "if $u$ and $v$ are binary strings in $\\mathcal{C},$ then the string $u\\oplus v$ is also in $\\mathcal{C}.$\n",
    "Here, $u\\oplus v$ refers to the bitwise exclusive-OR of $u$ and $v,$ as we encountered multiple times in the\n",
    "\"Fundamentals of quantum algorithms\" course.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, when we refer to a classical error correcting code as being *linear,* we're thinking about binary strings of length $n$ as being $n$-dimensional vectors, where the entries are all either $0$ or $1,$ and demanding that the code itself forms a linear subspace.\n",
    "Instead of ordinary vector addition over the real or complex numbers, however, we're using addition modulo $2,$ which is simply the exclusive-OR.\n",
    "That is, if we have two *codewords* $u$ and $v,$ meaning that $u$ and $v$ are binary strings in $\\mathcal{C},$ then $u + v$ modulo 2, which is to say $u\\oplus v,$ must also be a codeword in $\\mathcal{C}.$\n",
    "Notice, in particular, that this implication must be true even if $u = v.$\n",
    "This implies that $\\mathcal{C}$ must include the all-zero string $0^n,$ because the bitwise exclusive-OR of any string with itself is the all-zero string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: the 3-bit repetition code\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3-bit repetition code is an example of a classical linear code.\n",
    "In particular, we have $\\mathcal{C} = \\{000,111\\},$ so, with respect to the linearity condition, there are just two possible choices for $u$ and two possible choices for $v.$\n",
    "It's a trivial matter to go through the four possible pairs to see that we always get a codeword when we take the bitwise exclusive-OR:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "000 \\oplus 000 = 000, \\quad\n",
    "000 \\oplus 111 = 111, \\quad\n",

    "### Example: the $[7,4,3]$-Hamming code\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another example of a classical linear code called the $[7,4,3]$-Hamming code.\n",
    "It was one of the very first classical error correcting codes ever discovered, and it consists of these 16 binary strings of length 7.\n",
    "(Sometimes the $[7,4,3]$-Hamming code is understood to mean the code with these strings reversed, but we'll take it to be the code containing the strings shown here.)\n",

    "There is very simple logic behind the selection of these strings, but it's secondary to the lesson and won't be explained here.\n",
    "For now, it's enough to observe that this is a classical linear code: XORing any two of these strings together will always result in another string in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation $[7,4,3]$ (in single square brackets) means something analogous to the double square bracket notation for stabilizer codes mentioned in the previous lesson, but here it's for classical linear codes.\n",
    "In particular, codewords have $7$ bits, we can encode $4$ bits using the code (because there are $16 = 2^4$ codewords), and it happens to be a distance $3$ code, which means that any two distinct codewords must differ in at least $3$ positions — so at least $3$ bits must be flipped to change one codeword into another.\n",
    "The fact that this is a distance $3$ code implies that it can correct for up to one bit-flip error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Describing classical linear codes\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples just mentioned are very simple examples of classical linear codes, but even the $[7,4,3]$-Hamming code looks somewhat mysterious when the codewords are simply listed.\n",
    "There are better, more efficient ways to describe classical linear codes, including the following two ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Generators*. One way to describe a classical linear code is with a minimal list of codewords that *generates* the code, meaning that by taking all of the possible subsets of these codewords and XORing them together, we get the entire code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In greater detail, the strings $u_1,\\ldots,u_m\\in\\Sigma^n$ generate the classical linear code $\\mathcal{C}$ if\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathcal{C} = \\bigl\\{\\alpha_1 u_1 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\alpha_m u_m\\,:\\,\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_m\\in\\{0,1\\}\\bigr\\},\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   with the understanding that $\\alpha u = u$ when $\\alpha = 1$ and $\\alpha u = 0^n$ when $\\alpha = 0,$\n",
    "   and we say that this list is *minimal* if removing one of the strings generates a smaller code.\n",
    "   A natural way to think about such a description is that the collection $\\{u_1,\\ldots,u_m\\}$ forms a *basis* for $\\mathcal{C}$ as a subspace, where we're thinking about strings as vectors with binary-valued entries, keeping in mind that we're working in a vector space where arithmetic is done modulo $2.$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Parity checks*.\n",
    "   Another natural way to describe a classical linear code is by *parity checks* — meaning a minimal list of binary strings for which the strings in the code are precisely the ones whose *binary dot product* with every one of these parity check strings is zero. (Similar to the bitwise exclusive-OR, the binary dot product appeared several times in \"Fundamentals of quantum algorithms.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   That is, the strings $v_1,\\ldots,v_r\\in\\Sigma^n$ are parity check strings for the classical linear code $\\mathcal{C}$ if\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\mathcal{C} = \\bigl\\{ u\\in \\Sigma^n\\,:\\, u\\cdot v_1 = \\cdots = u \\cdot v_r = 0 \\bigr\\},\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   and this set of strings is *minimal* if removing one results in a larger code.\n",
    "   These are called parity check strings because $u$ has binary dot product equal to zero with $v$ if and only if the bits of $u$ in positions where $v$ has 1s have even parity.\n",
    "   So, to determine if a string $u$ is in the code $\\mathcal{C},$ it suffices to check the parity of certain subsets of the bits of $u.$\n",
    "\n",
    "   An important thing to notice here is that the binary dot product is not an inner product in a formal sense. In particular, when two strings have binary dot product equal to zero, it doesn't mean that they're orthogonal in the usual way we think about orthogonality. For example, the binary dot product of the string $11$ with itself is zero — so it is possible that a parity check string for a classical linear code is itself in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical linear codes over the binary alphabet always include a number of strings that's a power of $2$ — and for a single classical linear code described in the two different ways just described, it will always be the case that $n = m + r.$\n",
    "In particular, if we have a minimal set of $m$ generators, then the code encodes $m$ bits and we'll necessarily have $2^m$ codewords;\n",
    "and if we have a minimal set of $r$ parity check strings, then we'll have $2^{n-r}$ codewords.\n",
    "So, each generator doubles the size of the code space while each parity check string halves the size of the code space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the 3-bit repetition code is a linear code, so it can be described in both of these ways.\n",
    "In particular, there's only one choice for a generator that works: $111.$\n",
    "We can alternatively describe the code with two parity check strings, such as $110$ and $011$ — which should look familiar from our previous discussions of this code — or we could instead take the parity check strings to be $110$ and $101,$ or $101$ and $011.$ (Generators and parity check strings are generally not unique for a given classical linear code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a second example, consider the $[7,4,3]$-Hamming code.\n",
    "Here's one choice for a list of generators that works.\n",

    "Here, by the way, we see that *all* of our parity check strings are themselves in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final remark about classical linear codes, which connects them to the stabilizer formalism, is that parity check strings are equivalent to stabilizer generators that only consist of $Z$ and identity Pauli matrices.\n",
    "For instance, the parity check strings $110$ and $011$ for the 3-bit repetition code correspond precisely to the stabilizer generators $Z\\otimes Z\\otimes \\mathbb{I}$ and $\\mathbb{I}\\otimes Z\\otimes Z,$ which is consistent with the discussions of Pauli observables from the previous lesson.\n",

    "## Definition of CSS codes\n",

    "CSS codes are stabilizer codes obtained by combining together certain *pairs* of classical linear codes.\n",
    "This doesn't work for two arbitrary classical linear codes — the two codes must have a certain relationship.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the stabilizer formalism, stabilizer generators containing only $Z$ and identity Pauli matrices are equivalent to parity checks, as we just observed for the 3-bit repetition code.\n",

    "This is because, when the syndrome is measured, an arbitrary error on this number of qubits effectively collapses probabilistically into some combination of $X$ errors, $Z$ errors, or both — and then the $X$ errors and $Z$ errors are detected and corrected independently.\n",

    "In summary, provided that we have two classical linear codes (or two copies of a single classical linear code) that are compatible, in that they define $X$ and $Z$ stabilizer generators that commute, the CSS code we obtain by combining them inherits the error correction properties of those two codes, in the sense just described.\n",

    "This is because the total number of stabilizer generators for the CSS code is the *sum* of the number of parity checks for the two classical linear codes, and each stabilizer generator cuts the dimension of the code space in half.\n",
    "For example, the $[7,4,3]$-Hamming code allows for the encoding of four classical bits, because we have just three parity check strings for this code, whereas the 7-qubit Steane code only encodes one qubit, because it has six stabilizer generators.\n",

    "It may not be clear at this point why these dual codes are relevant, but they turn out to be quite relevant for multiple reasons, including the two reasons explained in the following paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the conditions that must hold for two classical linear codes $\\mathcal{C}_Z$ and $\\mathcal{C}_X$ to be compatible, in the sense that they can be paired together to form a CSS code, can be described in simple terms by referring to the dual codes.\n",
    "Specifically, it must be that $\\mathcal{D}_Z\\subseteq\\mathcal{C}_X,$ or equivalently, that $\\mathcal{D}_X\\subseteq\\mathcal{C}_Z.$\n",
    "In words, the dual code $\\mathcal{D}_Z$ includes the strings corresponding to $Z$ stabilizer generators, and their containment in $\\mathcal{C}_X$ is equivalent to the binary dot product of each of these strings with the ones corresponding to the $X$ stabilizer generators being zero.\n",
    "That, in turn, is equivalent to each $Z$ stabilizer generator commuting with each $X$ stabilizer generator.\n",
    "Alternatively, by reversing the roles of the $X$ and $Z$ stabilizer generators and starting from the containment $\\mathcal{D}_X\\subseteq\\mathcal{C}_Z,$ we can reach the same conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, by referring to the dual codes, we can easily describe the code spaces of a given CSS code.\n",
    "In particular, the code space is spanned by vectors of the following form.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vert u \\oplus \\mathcal{D}_X\\rangle\n",
    "= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^t}} \\sum_{v\\in\\mathcal{D}_X} \\vert u \\oplus v\\rangle \\qquad \\text{(for all $u\\in\\mathcal{C}_Z$)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, these vectors are uniform superpositions over the strings in the dual code $\\mathcal{D}_X$ of the code corresponding to the $X$ stabilizer generators, shifted by (in other words, bitwise XORed with) strings in the code $\\mathcal{C}_Z$ corresponding to the $Z$ stabilizer generators.\n",
    "To be clear, different choices for the shift — represented by the string $u$ in this expression — can result in the same vector.\n",
    "So, these states aren't all distinct, but collectively they span the entire code space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an intuitive explanation for why such vectors are both in the code space and span it.\n",
    "Consider the $n$-qubit standard basis state $\\vert u\\rangle,$ for some arbitrary $n$-bit string $u,$ and suppose that we *project* this state onto the code space.\n",
    "That is to say, letting $\\Pi$ denote the projection onto the code space of our CSS code, consider the vector $\\Pi\\vert u\\rangle.$\n",
    "There are two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Case 1: $u\\in\\mathcal{C}_Z.$\n",
    "  This implies that each $Z$ stabilizer generator of our CSS code acts trivially on $\\vert u\\rangle.$\n",
    "  The $X$ stabilizer generators, on the other hand, each simply flip some of the bits of $\\vert u\\rangle.$\n",
    "  In particular, for each generator $v$ of $\\mathcal{D}_X,$ the $X$ stabilizer generator corresponding to $v$ transforms $\\vert u\\rangle$ into $\\vert u\\oplus v\\rangle.$\n",
    "  By characterizing the projection $\\Pi$ as the *average* over the elements of the stabilizer (as we saw in the previous lesson), we obtain this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\Pi \\vert u \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2^t} \\sum_{v\\in\\mathcal{D}_{X}} \\vert u \\oplus v\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^t}} \\vert u \\oplus \\mathcal{D}_X\\rangle.\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Case 2: $u\\notin\\mathcal{C}_Z.$ This implies that at least one of the parity checks corresponding to the $Z$ stabilizer generators fails, which is to say that $\\vert u\\rangle$ must be a $-1$ eigenvector of at least one of the $Z$ stabilizer generators. The code space of the CSS code is the intersection of the $+1$ eigenspaces of the stabilizer generators. So, as a $-1$ eigenvector of at least one of the $Z$ stabilizer generators, $\\vert u\\rangle$ is therefore orthogonal to the code space:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\Pi\\vert u\\rangle = 0.\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And now, as we range over all $n$-bit strings $u,$ discard the ones for which $\\Pi\\vert u\\rangle = 0,$ and normalize the remaining ones, we obtain the vectors described previously, which demonstrates that they span the code space.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use the symmetry between $X$ and $Z$ stabilizer generators to describe the code space in a similar but different way.\n",
    "In particular, it is the space spanned by vectors having the following form.\n",
