    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we took a first look at quantum error correction, focusing specifically on the 9-qubit Shor code.\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll introduce the *stabilizer formalism*, which is a mathematical framework through which a broad class of quantum error correcting codes, known as *stabilizer codes*, can be specified and analyzed.\n",
    "This includes the 9-qubit Shor code along with many other examples, including codes that seem likely to be well-suited to real-world quantum devices.\n",
    "Not every quantum error correcting code is a stabilizer code, but many are, including every example that we'll see in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson begins with a short discussion of Pauli matrices, and tensor products of Pauli matrices more generally, which can represent not only operations on qubits, but also measurements of qubits — in which case they're typically referred to as *observables*.\n",
    "We'll then go back and take a second look at the repetition code and see how it can be described in terms of Pauli matrix observables.\n",
    "This will both inform and lead into a general discussion of stabilizer codes, including several examples, basic properties of stabilizer codes, and how the fundamental tasks of encoding, detecting errors, and correcting those errors can be performed.\n",
