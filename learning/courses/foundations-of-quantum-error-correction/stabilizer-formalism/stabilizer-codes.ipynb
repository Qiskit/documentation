    "\n",
    "Now we'll define stabilizer codes in general.\n",
    "We'll also discuss some of their basic properties and how they work, including how states can be encoded and how errors are detected and corrected using these codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of stabilizer codes\n",
    "\n",
    "An $n$-qubit stabilizer code is specified by a list of $n$-qubit Pauli operations, $P_1,\\ldots,P_r.$\n",
    "These operations are called *stabilizer generators* in this context, and they must satisfy the following three properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The stabilizer generators all *commute* with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P_j P_k = P_k P_j \\qquad \\text{(for all $j,k\\in\\{1,\\ldots,r\\}$)}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The stabilizer generators form a *minimal generating set*.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P_k \\notin \\langle P_1,\\ldots,P_{k-1},P_{k+1},\\ldots,P_r\\rangle \\qquad \\text{(for all $k\\in\\{1,\\ldots,r\\}$)}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. At least one quantum state vector is fixed by all of the stabilizer generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   -\\mathbb{I}^{\\otimes n} \\notin \\langle P_1,\\ldots, P_r\\rangle\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   (It's not obvious that the existence of a quantum state vector $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ fixed by all of the stabilizer generators, meaning $P_1 \\vert\\psi\\rangle = \\cdots = P_r \\vert\\psi\\rangle = \\vert\\psi\\rangle,$ is equivalent to $-\\mathbb{I}^{\\otimes n} \\notin \\langle P_1,\\ldots, P_r\\rangle,$ but indeed this is the case, and we'll see why a bit later in the lesson.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that we have such a list $P_1,\\ldots,P_r,$ the *code space* defined by these stabilizer generators is the subspace $\\mathcal{C}$ containing every $n$-qubit quantum state vector fixed by all $r$ of these stabilizer generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{C} = \\bigl\\{ \\vert\\psi\\rangle \\,:\\, P_1 \\vert\\psi\\rangle = \\cdots = P_r \\vert\\psi\\rangle = \\vert\\psi\\rangle \\bigr\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum state vectors in this subspace are precisely the ones that can be viewed as *valid encodings* of quantum states.\n",
    "We'll discuss the actual process of encoding later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the *stabilizer* of the code defined by the stabilizer generators $P_1, \\ldots, P_r$ is the set generated by these operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle P_1,\\ldots,P_r\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural way to think about a stabilizer code is to view the stabilizer generators as observables, and to collectively interpret the outcomes of the measurements associated with these observables as an error syndrome.\n",
    "Valid encodings are $n$-qubit quantum state vectors for which the measurement outcomes, as eigenvalues, are all guaranteed to be $+1.$\n",
    "Any other syndrome, where at least one $-1$ measurement outcome occurs, signals that an error has been detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take a look at several examples shortly, but first just a few remarks about the three conditions on stabilizer generators are in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first condition is natural, in light of the interpretation of the stabilizer generators as observables, for it implies that it doesn't matter in what order the measurements are performed: the observables commute, so the measurements commute.\n",
    "This naturally imposes certain algebraic constraints on stabilizer codes that are important to how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second condition requires that the stabilizer generators form a minimal generating set, meaning that removing any one of them would result in a smaller stabilizer.\n",
    "Strictly speaking, this condition isn't really essential to the way stabilizer codes work in an *operational* sense â€” and, as we'll see in the next lesson, it does sometimes make sense to think about sets of stabilizer generators for codes that actually don't satisfy this condition.\n",
    "For the sake of *analyzing* stabilizer codes and explaining their properties, however, we will assume that this condition is in place.\n",
    "In short, this condition guarantees that each observable that we measure to obtain the error syndrome *adds* information about possible errors, as opposed to being redundant and producing results that could be inferred from the other stabilizer generator measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third condition requires that at least one nonzero vector is fixed by all of the stabilizer generators, which is equivalent to $-\\mathbb{I}^{\\otimes n}$ not being contained in the stabilizer.\n",
    "The need for this condition comes from the fact that it actually is possible to choose a minimal generating set of $n$-qubit Pauli operations that all commute with one another, and yet no nonzero vectors are fixed by every one of the operations.\n",
    "We're not interested in \"codes\" for which there are no valid encodings, so we rule out this possibility by requiring this condition as a part of the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of stabilizer codes for small values of $n.$\n",

    "Clifford operations are unitary operations, on any number of qubits, that can be implemented by quantum circuits with a restricted set of gates:\n",
    "- Hadamard gates\n",
    "- $S$ gates\n",
    "- CNOT gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $T$ gates are not included, nor are Toffoli gates and Fredkin gates.\n",
    "Not only are those gates not included in the list, but in fact, it's not possible to implement those gates using the ones listed here; they're not Clifford operations.\n",
    "Pauli operations, on the other hand, are Clifford operations because they can be implemented with sequences of Hadamard and $S$ gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a simple way to define Clifford operations, but it doesn't explain why they're defined like this or what's special about this particular collection of gates.\n",
    "The *real* reason Clifford operations are defined like this is that, up to global phase factors, the Clifford operations are precisely the unitary operations that always transform Pauli operations into Pauli operations by conjugation.\n",
    "To be more precise, an $n$-qubit unitary operation $U$ is equivalent to a Clifford operation up to a phase factor if, and only if, for *every* $n$-qubit Pauli operation $P,$ we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U P U^{\\dagger} = \\pm Q\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for some $n$-qubit Pauli operation $Q.$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that it is not possible to have $U P U^{\\dagger} = \\alpha Q$ for $\\alpha\\notin\\{+1,-1\\}$ when $U$ is unitary and $P$ and $Q$ are Pauli operations.\n",
    "This follows from the fact that the matrix on the left-hand side of the equation in question is both unitary and Hermitian, and $+1$ and $-1$ are the only choices for $\\alpha$ that allow the right-hand side to be unitary and Hermitian as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is straightforward to verify the conjugation property just described when $U$ is a Hadamard, $S,$ or CNOT gate.\n",
    "In particular, this is easy for Hadamard gates,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H X H^{\\dagger} = Z, \\qquad\n",
    "H Y H^{\\dagger} = -Y, \\qquad\n",
    "H Z H^{\\dagger} = X,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $S$ gates,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S X S^{\\dagger} = Y, \\qquad\n",
    "S Y S^{\\dagger} = -X, \\qquad\n",
    "S Z S^{\\dagger} = Z.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For CNOT gates, there are 15 non-identity Pauli operations on two qubits to check.\n",
    "Naturally, they can be checked individually â€” but the relationships between CNOT gates and $X$ and $Z$ gates listed (in circuit form) in the previous lesson, together with the multiplication rules for Pauli matrices, offer a shortcut to the same conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know this conjugation property is true for Hadamard, $S,$ and CNOT gates, we can immediately conclude that it is true for *circuits* composed of these gates â€” which is to say, all Clifford operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is more difficult to prove that the relationship works in the other direction, which is that if a given unitary operation $U$ satisfies the conjugation property for Pauli operations, then it must be possible to implement it (up to a global phase) using just Hadamard, $S,$ and CNOT gates.\n",
    "This won't be explained in this lesson, but it is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clifford operations are not universal for quantum computation; unlike universal sets of quantum gates, approximating arbitrary unitary operations to any desired level of accuracy with Clifford operations is not possible.\n",
    "Indeed, for a given value of $n,$ there are only *finitely* many $n$-qubit Clifford operations (up to phase factors).\n",
    "Performing Clifford operations on standard basis states followed by standard basis measurements also can't allow us to perform computations that are outside of the reach of classical algorithms â€” because we can *efficiently simulate* computations of this form classically.\n",
    "This fact is known as the *Gottesman-Knill theorem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoders for stabilizer codes\n",
    "\n",
    "A stabilizer code defines a code space of a certain dimension, and we have the freedom to use that code space however we choose â€”\n",
    "nothing forces us to encode qubits into this code space in a specific way.\n",
    "It is always possible, however, to use a *Clifford operation* as an encoder, if we choose to do that.\n",
    "To be more precise, for any stabilizer code that allows $m$ qubits to be encoded into $n$ qubits, there's an $n$-qubit Clifford operation $U$ such that, for any $m$-qubit quantum state vector $\\vert\\phi\\rangle,$ we have that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vert\\psi\\rangle = U \\bigl(\\vert 0^{n-m} \\rangle \\otimes \\vert \\phi\\rangle\\bigr)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is a quantum state vector in the code space of our code that we may interpret as an encoding of $\\vert\\phi\\rangle.$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is good because Clifford operations are relatively simple, compared with arbitrary unitary operations, and there are ways to optimize their implementation using techniques similar to ones found in the proof of the Gottesman-Knill theorem.\n",
    "As a result, circuits for encoding states using stabilizer codes never need to be too large.\n",
    "In particular, it is always possible to perform an encoding for an $n$-qubit stabilizer code using a Clifford operation that requires $O(n^2/\\log(n))$ gates.\n",
    "This is because *every* Clifford operation on $n$ qubits can be implemented by a circuit of this size.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's an encoder for the 7-qubit Steane code.\n",
    "It is indeed a Clifford operation, and as it turns out, this one doesn't even need $S$ gates.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Clifford encoder for the 7-qubit Steane code](/learning/images/courses/foundations-of-quantum-error-correction/stabilizer-formalism/Steane-encoder.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detecting errors\n",
    "\n",
    "For an $n$-qubit stabilizer code described by stabilizer generators $P_1,\\ldots, P_r,$ error detection works in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "To detect errors, all of the stabilizer generators are measured as observables.\n",
    "There are $r$ stabilizer generators, and therefore $r$ measurement outcomes, each one being $+1$ or $-1$ (or a binary value if we choose to associate $0$ with $+1$ and $1$ with $-1,$ respectively).\n",
    "We interpret the $r$ outcomes collectively, as a vector or string, as a *syndrome.*\n",
    "The syndrome $(+1,\\ldots,+1)$ indicates that no error has been detected, while at least one $-1$ somewhere within the syndrome indicates an error has been detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, in particular, that $E$ is an $n$-qubit Pauli operation, representing a hypothetical error.\n",
    "(We're only considering Pauli operations as errors, by the way, because the discretization of errors works the same way for arbitrary stabilizer codes as it does for the 9-qubit Shor code.)\n",
    "There are three cases that determine whether or not $E$ is detected as an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error detection cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The operation $E$ is proportional to an element in the stabilizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   E = \\pm Q \\; \\text{for some}\\; Q \\in \\langle P_1,\\ldots,P_r\\rangle\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this case, $E$ must commute with every stabilizer generator, so we obtain the syndrome $(+1,\\ldots,+1).$  This means that $E$ is not detected as an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The operation $E$ is not proportional to an element in the stabilizer, but it nevertheless commutes with every stabilizer generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   E\\neq \\pm Q\\; \\text{for} \\; Q \\in \\langle P_1,\\ldots,P_r\\rangle, \\;\\text{but}\\;\n",
    "   E P_k = P_k E \\;\\text{for every}\\; k\\in\\{1,\\ldots,r\\}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   This is an error that changes vectors in the code space in some nontrivial way. But, because $E$ commutes with every stabilizer generator, the syndrome is $(+1,\\ldots,+1),$ so $E$ goes undetected by the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The operation $E$ anti-commutes with at least one of the stabilizer generators.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P_k E = -E P_k \\; \\text{for at least one} \\; k\\in\\{1,\\ldots,r\\}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   The syndrome is different than $(+1,\\ldots,+1),$ so the error $E$ is detected by the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, the error $E$ is not a concern because this operation does nothing to vectors in the code space, except to possibly inject an irrelevant global phase: $E \\ket{\\psi} = \\pm\\ket{\\psi}$ for every encoded state $\\ket{\\psi}.$ In essence, this is not actually an error â€” whatever nontrivial action $E$ may have happens outside of the code space â€” so it's good that $E$ is not detected as an error, because nothing needs to be done about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second case, intuitively speaking, is the bad case.\n",
    "It's the *anti-commutation* of an error with a stabilizer generator that causes a $-1$ to appear somewhere in the syndrome, signaling an error, but that doesn't happen in this case.\n",
    "So, we have an error $E$ that does change vectors in the code space in some nontrivial way, but it goes undetected by the code.\n",
    "For example, for the 3-bit repetition code, the operation $E = X\\otimes X\\otimes X$ falls into this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that such an error $E$ must change some vectors in the code space in a non-trivial way can be argued as follows.\n",
    "By the assumption that $E$ commutes with $P_1,\\ldots,P_r$ but is not proportional to a stabilizer element, we can conclude that we would obtain a new, valid stabilizer code by including $E$ as a stabilizer generator along with $P_1,\\ldots,P_r.$\n",
    "The code space for this new code, however, has only half the dimension of the original code space, from which we can conclude that the action of $E$ on the original code space cannot be proportional to the identity operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last of the three cases, which is that the error $E$ anti-commutes with at least one stabilizer generator,\n",
    "the syndrome has at least one $-1$ somewhere in it, which indicates that something is wrong.\n",
    "As we have already discussed, the syndrome won't uniquely identify $E$ in general, so it's still necessary to choose a correction operation for each syndrome, which might or might not correct the error $E.$\n",
    "We'll discuss this step shortly, in the last part of the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance of a stabilizer code\n",
    "\n",
    "As a point of terminology, when we refer to the *distance* of a stabilizer code, we mean the *minimum weight* of a Pauli operation $E$ that falls into the second category above â€” meaning that it changes the code space in some nontrivial way, but the code doesn't detect this.\n",
    "When it is said that a stabilizer code is an $[[n,m,d]]$ stabilizer code, using double square brackets, this means the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encodings are $n$ qubits in length,\n",
    "2. the code allows for the encoding $m$ qubits, and\n",
    "3. the distance of the code is $d.$\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's consider the 7-qubit Steane code.\n",
    "Here are the stabilizer generators for this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{ccccccc}\n",
    "Z & Z & Z & Z & \\mathbb{I} & \\mathbb{I} & \\mathbb{I} \\\\[1mm]\n",
    "Z & Z & \\mathbb{I} & \\mathbb{I} & Z & Z & \\mathbb{I} \\\\[1mm]\n",
    "Z & \\mathbb{I} & Z & \\mathbb{I} & Z & \\mathbb{I} & Z \\\\[1mm]\n",
    "X & X & X & X & \\mathbb{I} & \\mathbb{I} & \\mathbb{I} \\\\[1mm]\n",
    "X & X & \\mathbb{I} & \\mathbb{I} & X & X & \\mathbb{I} \\\\[1mm]\n",
    "X & \\mathbb{I} & X & \\mathbb{I} & X & \\mathbb{I} & X\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This code has distance 3, and we can argue this as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First consider any Pauli operation $E$ having weight at most 2, and suppose this operation commutes with all six stabilizer generators.\n",
    "We will conclude that $E$ must be the identity operation, which (as always) is an element of the stabilizer.\n",
    "This will show that the distance of the code is strictly greater than 2.\n",
    "Suppose, in particular, that $E$ takes the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = P \\otimes Q \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes \\mathbb{I}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $P$ and $Q$ being possibly non-identity Pauli matrices.\n",
    "This is just one case, and it is necessary to repeat the argument that follows for all of the other possible locations for non-identity Pauli matrices among the tensor factors of $E,$ but the argument is essentially the same for all of the possible locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation $E$ commutes with all six stabilizer generators, so it commutes with these two in particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{gathered}\n",
    "Z \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes Z \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes Z \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes Z\\\\[1mm]\n",
    "X \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes X \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes X \\otimes \\mathbb{I} \\otimes X\n",
    "\\end{gathered}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The tensor factor $Q$ in our error $E$ lines up with the identity matrix in both of these stabilizer generators (which is why they were selected).\n",
    "Given that we have identity matrices in the rightmost 5 positions of $E,$ we conclude that $P$ must commute with $X$ and $Z,$ for otherwise $E$ would anti-commute with one of the two generators.\n",
    "However, the only Pauli matrix that commutes with both $X$ and $Z$ is the identity matrix, so $P = \\mathbb{I}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know this, we can choose two more stabilizer generators that have an $X$ and a $Z$ in the second position from left, and we draw a similar conclusion: $Q = \\mathbb{I}.$\n",
    "It is therefore the case that $E$ is the identity operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there's no way for an error having weight at most 2 to go undetected by this code, unless the error is the identity operation (which is in the stabilizer and therefore not actually an error).\n",
    "On the other hand, there are weight 3 Pauli operations that commute with all six of these stabilizer generators, but aren't proportional to stabilizer elements, such as $\\mathbb{I}\\otimes\\mathbb{I}\\otimes\\mathbb{I}\\otimes\\mathbb{I}\\otimes X\\otimes X\\otimes X$\n",
    "and $\\mathbb{I}\\otimes\\mathbb{I}\\otimes\\mathbb{I}\\otimes\\mathbb{I}\\otimes Z\\otimes Z\\otimes Z.$\n",
    "This establishes that this code has distance 3, as claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Correcting errors\n",
    "\n",
    "The last topic of discussion for this lesson is the *correction* of errors for stabilizer codes.\n",
    "As usual, assume that we have a stabilizer code specified by n-qubit stabilizer generators $P_1, \\ldots, P_r.$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $n$-qubit Pauli operations, as errors that could affect states encoded using this code, are partitioned into equal-sized collections according to which syndrome they cause to appear.\n",
    "There are $2^r$ distinct syndromes and $4^n$ Pauli operations, which means there are $4^n/2^r$ Pauli operations causing each syndrome.\n",
    "Any one of these errors could be responsible for the corresponding syndrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, among the $4^n/2^r$ Pauli operations that cause each syndrome, there are some that should be considered as being equivalent.\n",
    "In particular, if the product of two Pauli operations is proportional to a stabilizer element, then those two operations are effectively equivalent as errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to say this is that if we apply a correction operation $C$ to attempt to correct an error $E,$ then this correction succeeds so long as the composition $CE$ is proportional to a stabilizer element.\n",
    "Given that there are $2^r$ elements in the stabilizer, it follows that each correction operation $C$ corrects $2^r$ different Pauli errors.\n",
    "This leaves $4^{n-r}$ inequivalent classes of Pauli operations, considered as errors, that are consistent with each possible syndrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, unless $n=r$ (in which case we have a trivial, one-dimensional code space), we can't possibly correct every error detected by a stabilizer code.\n",
    "What we must do instead is to choose just *one* correction operation for each syndrome, in the hopes of correcting just one class of equivalent errors that cause this syndrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "One natural strategy for choosing which correction operation to perform for each syndrome is to choose the *lowest weight* Pauli operation that, as an error, causes that syndrome.\n",
    "There may in fact be multiple operations that tie for the lowest weight error consistent with a given syndrome, in which case any one of them may be selected.\n",
    "The idea is that lower-weight Pauli operations represent more likely explanations for whatever syndrome has been measured.\n",
    "This might actually not be the case for some noise models, and one alternative strategy is to compute the most *likely* error that causes the given syndrome, based on the chosen noise model.\n",
    "For this lesson, however, we'll keep things simple and only consider lowest-weight corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a distance $d$ stabilizer code, this strategy of choosing the correction operation to be a lowest weight Pauli operation consistent with the measured syndrome always allows for the correction of errors having weight strictly less than half of $d,$ or in other words, weight at most $(d-1)/2.$\n",
    "This shows, for instance, that the 7-qubit Steane code can correct for any weight-one Pauli error, and by the discretization of errors, this means that the Steane code can correct for an arbitrary error on one qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this works, consider the diagram below.\n",
    "The circle on the left represents all of the Pauli operations that result in the syndrome $(+1,\\ldots,+1),$ which is the syndrome that suggests that no errors have occurred and nothing is wrong.\n",
    "Among these operations we have elements of the stabilizer (or operations that are *proportional* to elements of the stabilizer, to be more precise) and we also have non-trivial errors that change the code space in some way but aren't detected by the code.\n",
    "By the definition of distance, every Pauli operation in this category must have weight at least $d,$ because $d$ is defined as the minimum weight of these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The circle on the right represents the Pauli operations that result in a different syndrome $s\\neq(+1,\\ldots,+1),$ including an error $E$ having weight strictly less than $d/2$ that we will consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lowest-weight error correction diagram](/learning/images/courses/foundations-of-quantum-error-correction/stabilizer-formalism/lowest-weight-correction.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correction operation $C$ chosen for the syndrome $s$ is the lowest weight Pauli operation in the collection represented by the circle on the right in the diagram (or any one of them in case there's a tie).\n",
    "So, it could be that $C = E,$ but not necessarily.\n",
    "What we can say for certain, however, is that $C$ cannot have weight larger than the weight of $E,$ because $C$ has minimal weight among the operations in this collection â€” and therefore $C$ has weight strictly less than $d/2.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider what happens when the correction operation $C$ is applied to whatever state we obtained after the error $E$ takes place.\n",
    "Assuming that the original encoding was $\\vert\\psi\\rangle,$ we're left with $CE\\vert\\psi\\rangle.$\n",
    "Our goal will be to show that $CE$ is proportional to an element in the stabilizer, implying that the correction is successful and (up to a global phase) we're left with the original encoded state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle.$\n",
    "\n",
    "First, because $E$ and $C$ cause the same syndrome, the composition $CE$ must commute with every stabilizer generator.\n",
    "In particular, if $P_k$ is any one of the stabilizer generators, then we must have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_k E = \\alpha E P_k\n",
    "\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n",
    "P_k C = \\alpha C P_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for the same value of $\\alpha\\in\\{+1,-1\\},$ because this is the $k$-th entry in the syndrome $s$ that both $C$ and $E$ generate.\n",
    "Hence, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_k (CE) = \\alpha C P_k E = \\alpha^2 (CE) P_k = (CE) P_k,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so $P_k$ commutes with $CE.$\n",
    "We've therefore shown that $CE$ belongs in the circle on the left in the diagram, because it generates the syndrome $(+1,\\ldots,+1).$\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the composition $CE$ must have weight at most the sum of the weights of $C$ and $E$ â€” which follows from a moment's thought about products of Pauli operations â€” and therefore the weight of $CE$ is strictly less than $d.$\n",
    "This implies that $CE$ is proportional to an element in the stabilizer of our code, which is what we wanted to show.\n",
    "By choosing our correction operations to be lowest-weight representatives of the set of errors that generate each syndrome, we're therefore guaranteed to correct any Pauli errors having weight less than half of the distance of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one problem, however.\n",
    "For stabilizer codes in general, it's a computationally difficult problem to compute the lowest weight Pauli operation causing a given syndrome.\n",
    "(Indeed, this is true even for classical codes, which in this context we can think of as stabilizer codes where we only have $\\mathbb{I}$ and $Z$ matrices appearing as tensor factors within the stabilizer generators.)\n",
    "So, unlike the encoding step, Clifford operations will not be coming to our rescue this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to choose specific codes for which good corrections can be computed efficiently, for which there's no simple recipe.\n",
    "Simply put, devising stabilizer codes for which good correction operations can be computed efficiently is part of the artistry of quantum code design.\n",
    "We'll see this artistry on display in the next lesson."
