# Overview

!["Hero image"](/learning/images/courses/foundations-of-quantum-error-correction/hero.svg)

Welcome to *Foundations of Quantum Error Correction,* the fourth course in the *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation* series comprising the following courses:

- [Basics of quantum information](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information)
- [Fundamentals of quantum algorithms](/learning/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms)
- [General formulation of quantum information](/learning/courses/general-formulation-of-quantum-information)
- Foundations of quantum error correction (this course)

This course is on quantum error correction, with a focus on foundational concepts. 
It begins with an explanation of what quantum error correcting codes are and how they work. 
It then moves on to the discretization of errors phenomenon, the stabilizer formalism for 
describing quantum error correcting codes, Calderbank–Shor–Steane (CSS) codes, and several 
key examples of quantum error correcting codes, including the toric code and surface codes. 
The course also discusses fault-tolerant quantum computation, in which quantum computations 
are performed on error-corrected quantum information.

This course is intended for students, professionals, and hobbyists in fields such as computer science, physics, 
engineering, and mathematics who are eager to gain knowledge on the theoretical foundations of quantum information 
and computation.
