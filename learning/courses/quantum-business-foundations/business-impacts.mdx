# Business impacts
## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

*   Recognize the benefits of exploring quantum computing now.
*   Identify the industries and applications where quantum computing shows promise.

## Potential quantum industry applications

Classical supercomputers struggle to solve problems with many variables interacting in complicated ways, like modeling molecular behavior. These classical limitations pose barriers to progress for a wide range of industries, and impede important research in physics, chemistry, materials science, and more.

To understand how a molecule will behave, scientists often have to synthesize it and experiment with it in the real world. To see how a slight tweak would impact its behavior, they usually need to synthesize the new version and run their experiment all over again. This is an expensive and time-consuming process. It hampers the development of stronger, lighter materials for aerospace engineering, constrains the evolution of semiconductors, and hinders advancements in medical science. Quantum could help us push past barriers of complexity.

We expect quantum to have the biggest impact in areas like machine learning, the simulation of natural systems, and the creation of useful new materials.

IBM is exploring industries where quantum computing is expected to show opportunity. The image below lists several use cases for a variety of industries, and the following sections of this lesson describe how some of our partners are exploring some of these use cases.

![Use Cases](/learning/images/courses/quantum-business-foundations/business-impacts/use-cases-by-industry.avif)

## Distribution & logistics

When you think of supercomputers, you might think of national labs. But did you know that one of the biggest supercomputers is operated by Walmart? As an [article by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/quantum-computing-use-cases-are-getting-real-what-you-need-to-know) points out, travel, transport, and logistics show promise for quantum computing.

Many of the largest computing systems are dedicated to solving optimization and AI problems in the airline, logistics, retail and consumer products industries. Large and complex optimization and scenario simulation problems arise in network planning, routing, scheduling, pricing, cargo loading, and disruption management. Providing memorable customer experiences by serving individualized content and making timely and relevant recommendations is powered by evolving AI models. However, the problem of complexity usually scales exponentially with the problem size.

NC State, in collaboration with Delta Air Lines, investigated the [application of quantum technology to airline gate-scheduling optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09472). Potential use cases for airlines include more efficient disruption management simulation, airline network planning, and optimization of air cargo loads.

![Quantum computing use cases for airlines](/learning/images/courses/quantum-business-foundations/business-impacts/quantum_computing_use_cases_for_airlines.avif)

For the logistics industry, which is facing significant acceleration in online commerce, quantum computers may be capable of supporting global routing optimization and frequent re-optimization to create profitable multimodal transportation and last mile delivery services. Quantum computing may help simulate the impacts of logistics disruptions with better accuracy and support sustainable logistics processes, such as container shipping optimization.

Integrated classical–quantum solutions may improve customer profiling and relevant next best action recommendations for retail and consumer products industries. Continuous new product innovation is a key factor for these industries, and quantum computing could play a critical role in the development and testing of new products. Streamlining the supply chain through optimization may better support companies’ efforts to navigate complexity and manage a balance between inventory shortage and surplus.

Quantum computers provide a tool to look at these problems in a different way. Scientists continue to experiment with better algorithms to apply to these problems. In anticipation of commercial quantum computing, leading companies are identifying and testing use cases that generate in-house quantum capabilities. The more effectively designed a use case is, the more likely it will be to deliver business value. Take, for example, the use case of untangling operational disruption in airline schedules and staffing. This use case shows promise because it has the potential to offer a disruptive solution for a core business problem in the future; there is an existing, though sub-optimal, classical alternative; and quantum algorithms have already been shown to be effective in choosing the best scenarios in Monte Carlo simulations used in banking and finance. Strategic use cases such as this one attend to near-term technical feasibility; consider the potential for quantum computing technology to outperform classical alternatives; and assess the projected business impact, as determined by market outcomes, competitive consequences, and financial impact. For some key business problems, even a slight advantage can have significant impact.

## Financial services

Banking, financial markets, and insurance firms are about managing risk. Wall Street behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs hope quantum computing can give them an edge in the odds, allowing them to better manage threats and opportunities related to their portfolios. Quantum computers could also help financial pros improve on their Monte Carlo simulations, mathematical models that predict possible outcomes of complicated decision trees to maximize profit. Other areas of quantum experimentation include fraud detection, anti-money laundering, credit scoring, precise customer profiling, more efficient risk management, and optimization of pricing models.

IBM researchers developed a quantum algorithm that outperforms the traditional approach of Monte Carlo sampling. In a Monte Carlo simulation, the computer takes many random samples from a given probability distribution to see which outcome is most likely. Reducing the error on the predicted outcome of the Monte Carlo simulation by a factor of $1/X$ requires $X^2$ more traditional samples, but only $X$ more quantum samples. You can view the impact of this statement in two ways: (1) you can get to a fixed confidence level faster with a quantum computer, or (2) for fixed time, a quantum computer can give you more confidence in your answer than a classical Monte Carlo solution would.

Manufacturing may become an early beneficiary of quantum computing. Use cases in chemistry and materials as well as optimization applications in production planning, fabrication, logistics and supply chain, as well as machine learning for quality control, for example, are all potential areas where quantum computing may have an impact. This graphic depicts the categorization of potential quantum computing use cases in manufacturing.

![Potential quantum computing use cases](/learning/images/courses/quantum-business-foundations/business-impacts/potential_use_cases.avif)

Many companies are exploring potential quantum computing applications in aerospace, automotive, and electronics manufacturing.

Quantum applications in aerospace and defense include flight route optimization, computational fluid dynamics, and material development.

The automotive industry could potentially benefit from quantum computing in a variety of areas such as new battery design and development, software verification and validation, factory automation, quality control, and advanced driver assistance. Daimler Mercedes-Benz, used quantum computing for optimizing transportation logistics and chemistry of vehicle batteries. Ben Boeser, innovation director for the company’s North American R\&D unit, says that developing and perfecting more energy-dense battery technologies could “unlock a billion-dollar opportunity.” Simulating all the various molecular properties and behaviors is beyond the current computing power of even today’s supercomputers. Quantum computing offers a potential way to speed up the simulation process. Boeser notes that “the multiyear process of testing and validating new battery technology could translate into missed opportunities in the market if this work is delayed,” which is why Daimler Mercedez-Benz worked with IBM Quantum to harness the power of [quantum for battery research](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/daimler) as the technology advances.

In electronics, quantum computing could improve manufacturing throughput with complex, dynamic fab scheduling; optimize product performance, such as chip performance, power, and area; and even accelerate the commercialization of advanced materials with larger, more accurate molecular simulations. JSR is partnering with IBM Quantum to explore how quantum computing can advance semiconductor chip research, namely in the development and manufacture of photoresists.
