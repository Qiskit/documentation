    "\n",
    "There are infinitely many ways of encrypting and decrypting information, and literally thousands of ways have been well-studied. Here, we will restrict ourselves to a very early and very simple method of encryption, called \"simple replacement\", in order to focus on the quantum part of this protocol. The quantum part could be adapted to many other protocols with relatively few changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple replacement encryption is one in which one letter or number is replaced with another, such that there is a 1:1 mapping from the letters and numbers in a message, to the letters and numbers being used in an encrypted sequence. A pop-culture instance of these is the cryptoquote or crypogram puzzle, in which a quote or phrase is encrypted using simple replacement, and the player is tasked with decrypting it. These are easy to solve if they are long enough. Consider the example:\n",

    "VMLFTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "People who solve these by hand mostly use tricks involving familiarity with the structure of the language of the original message. For example, in English, the only one-letter words like the encrypted \"R\" are \"a\" and \"I\". The double letters encrypted in, for example, \"KIVGGB\" can only take certain values. There are subtler things that give clues like the most common word fitting the \"GSZG\" pattern is \"that\". People using code to solve this have many more options, including simply scanning through possibilities until an English word is recovered, and updating while preserving that word. One simple but powerful method is using letter frequency, especially when the message is long enough to constitute a representative sample of English.\n",

Informally, it says that there is no unitary (quantum mechanical) operation that can make a second copy of an arbitrary quantum state, while preserving the first copy. The proof is relatively simple, and is left as a guided exercise. But for now, understand that Eve making copies of the quantum state is forbidden by fundamental laws of nature, and this is a principle strength of QKD."

    "Alice and Bob have once again communicated a bit string... but the strings don't match. The far left and middle bits are flipped. Looking at the previous table, you can trace this mismatch to the interference from Eve. Critically, note that we can do statistics on the match between our bitstrings now, while setting up the key, long before sharing our encrypted secret. Alice and Bob are free to use as many of their one-time pad bits as they like to check the security of their channel. If a single bit, or a very small percentage of bits did not match, this might be attributable to noise or errors. But a substantial fraction of mismatches indicates eavesdropping. The meaning of \"substantial\" here depends a bit on the noise in the setup being used; what is means for IBM quantum computers is discussed below when we implement this protocol. If excess errors are detected, Alice and Bob do not share the secret, and they can begin hunting the eavesdropper.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "Proving security is extremely difficult. In fact the protocol loosely described here was proposed in 1984, and wasn't proved secure until 16 years later [Shor & Preskill, 2000](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.441). There are many subtleties that are beyond the scope of this introduction. But we will briefly list a few to demonstrate that the topic is more complex than illustrated here.\n",
    "* __Secure channels:__ When Alice sends her qubits through some quantum setup (a channel), and in particular when she hears classical responses back from someone, we have assumed that the someone is actually Bob. If Eve infiltrated this setup in such a way that __all__ Alice's communication was actually happening with Eve, and __all__ Bob's communication was actually being done with Eve, then Eve has effectively obtained a key, and can learn secrets. One must first ensure \"secure channels\", a process with a different set of protocols that we have not addressed here.\n",
    "* __Assumptions about Eve:__ To truly prove security, we can't make assumptions about Eve's behavior; she could always confound our expectations. Here, to give concrete examples, we are making assumptions. For example, we might assume that the states Eve sends on to Bob are always exactly those she obtained upon measurement. Or we might assume that she randomly chooses a state experimentally consistent with her measurement. More fundamentally, the language here assumes that Eve actually makes a measurement, as opposed to storing the state on another quantum system and sending on a random qubit to Bob. These assumptions are fine to understand the protocol, but they do mean we are not proving anything in full generality.\n",
    "* __Privacy amplification:__ Alice and Bob are not required to use the quantum key exactly as transmitted. They can, for example, apply a hash function to the shared key. This would exploit the fact that the eavesdropper has incomplete knowledge of the key to produce a shorter, but secure, shared key."

    "First, a note on quantum simulators: Most quantum problems involving more than ~30 qubits cannot be simulated by most computers. No classical computer, supercomputer or GPU can simulate the full range of behavior of a 127-qubit quantum computer. Usually, the motivation for using real quantum computers is that the many entangled qubits cannot be simulated. In this case, there is no entanglement of qubits, unless we use the teleportation scheme to move information. In this case, the motivation for using real quantum computers is different: it is the no-cloning theorem. A classical computer simulating a qubit could send information about a quantum state from Alice to Bob, but if this classical information were intercepted, it could easily be duplicated, and Eve could keep a perfect copy, while sending another to Bob. This is not possible with real quantum states.\n",

    "(a) The answer depends on how many randomly-chosen bases matched between Alice and Bob. Since there is roughly a 50-50 chance of the bases matching for any given qubit, we expect close to 10 of our bits to be useful. 9 or 11 will be perfectly common. Even 4 or 15 are not outside the realm of possibility. 5 bits are required to shift by a number greater than or equal to the length of the English alphabet, meaning you can apply the shift to one letter for every 5 bits you have. If you have at least 5 bits shared by Alice and Bob, you can encode a single letter. If you have at least 10, you can enocde 2 letters, and so on. (b) It need not agree, for the reasons outlined in (a).\n",

    "## Review and questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantum information cannot be copied or \"cloned\".\n",
    "- You *can* repeat the same preparation process to make an ensemble of quantum states which are all the same, or nearly the same.\n",
    "- An encryption/decryption key (a one-time pad) can be shared between two friends using quantum states.\n",
    "- Two friends randomly choosing a measurement basis means that half the time they will choose differently, and will have to toss out the information on those qubits.\n",
    "- The random choice of measurement basis also ensures that an eavesdropper cannot know the initial state prepared, and thus cannot recreate the sent state. This ensures that the eavesdropping will be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### T/F questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T/F In quantum key distribution, the two communicating partners measure each qubit in the same basis.\n",
    "2. T/F An eavesdropper intercepting quantum information in QKD is prevented by the laws of nature from copying the quantum state they intercept.\n",
    "3. T/F A one-time pad is a key for encrypting/decrypting secure messages in which a particular encoding scheme is used only once, for a single piece of information (like one letter of the alphabet).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MC questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select the option that best completes the statement. As described in this module, a one-time pad is a set of encryption/decryption keys that is used...\n",
    "\n",
    "- a. Only once for a single piece of information, like a single letter.\n",
    "- b. Only once for a single message.\n",
    "- c. Only once for a set period of time, like a day.\n",
    "- d. Until there is evidence of eavesdropping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assume Alice and Bob choose their measurement bases randomly. They measure. Then they share their measurement bases, and keep only the bits of information from cases where they used the same basis. Up to some random fluctuation, approximately what percentage of their qubits should yield usable bits of information?\n",
    "- a. 100%\n",
    "- b. 50%\n",
    "- c. 25%\n",
    "- d. 12.5%\n",
    "- e. 0%\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After Alice and Bob select cases in which they used the same measurement bases, what percentage of those bits of information should match, if quantum noise and errors were negligible?\n",
    "- a. 100%\n",
    "- b. 50%\n",
    "- c. 25%\n",
    "- d. 12.5%\n",
    "- e. 0%\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Assume Alice has chosen her measurement bases randomly. Eve also chooses her bases randomly, and she listens in (measures). She sends states on to Bob that are consistent with her measurements. Alice and Bob compare basis choices and keep only the qubits measured/prepared by them in the same bases. Up to some random fluctuation, approximately what percentage of those kept qubit measurements will match, according to Alice and Bob?\n",
    "- a. 100%\n",

    "- c. 50%\n",
    "- d. 25%\n",
    "- e. 12.5%\n",
    "- f. 0%\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume all basis choices are random for all participants, Alice, Bob, and Eve. Assume that after Eve listens in, she sends a state to Bob that is prepared in the same basis in which she measured, and which is consistent with that measurement. Convince your partners that 12.5% of all qubits initialized by Alice will yield measurement mismatches between Alice and Bob, indicating eavesdropping (ignoring quantum errors and noise).\n",
    "Hint 1: Since there is no preferred basis, if you consider just one initial choice for Alice, the ratio for that one choice should be the same as the ratio for the sum of all choices.\n",
    "Hint 2: It may not be sufficient to count the number of ways something could happen, since some outcomes may occur with different probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assume again that all basis choices are random for all participants, Alice, Bob, and Eve. But now, consider that Eve is free to send along any state she likes after her measurement. She could even try sending states that are inconsistent with her own measurements. Discuss with your partners/neighbors whether you think there is any choice of bases that could reduce the average percentage of qubits that indicate eavesdropping to Alice and Bob."
