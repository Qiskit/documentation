The solutions we are looking for—specifically the system's ground state—are the lowest eigenvalues of this matrix. The challenge, however, is that for practical problems, this Hamiltonian matrix is very large. It grows exponentially with the size of the system, quickly becoming too big ($2^n$ where $n$ is the number of qubits) for even the most powerful supercomputers to store or solve directly.\n",

For truly massive problems, like complex chemical structures or binding sites, even the projected matrix may still be challenging to diagonalize. Thus, such problems are ideally-suited to leverage the strengths of both quantum and classical computing resources.\n",

    "## Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) is a powerful variational algorithm that implements the subspace method in a quantum way. It avoids costly, complex procedures like Hadamard tests by using a quantum computer to prepare a trial state and sample *bitstrings*, which define the subspace for classical diagonalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A schematic of the workflow specific to sample-based quantum diagonalization. The steps include a variational quantum circuit, using measurements to project the Hamiltonian into a subspace, then using a classical optimizer to update variational parameters in the circuit and repeating.](/learning/images/courses/integrating-quantum-and-high-performance-computing/sqd-skqd/sqd-cycle.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The SQD algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Prepare the Ansatz state\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $H = \\sum_{j=1}^Q \\alpha_j P_j$ be the Hamiltonian on $n$ qubits. While the true ground state may be supported on all $2^n$ basis states, SQD is most effective in instances where the ground state can be well-approximated by a sparse subspace (a polynomially-sized set of bitstrings).\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct this subspace, we start with an input state $|\\phi_0\\rangle$, such as the Hartree-Fock (HF) state in chemistry. We then apply a parameterized quantum circuit, $U(\\theta)$, which is known as the ansatz.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A diagram showing the overlap of the computational basis states making up the ansatz and those making up the true ground state. Specifically, the image shows that the two regions will have some overlap, but might not perfectly match.](/learning/images/courses/integrating-quantum-and-high-performance-computing/sqd-skqd/ansatz.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram illustrates the goal of a good ansatz. The ansatz prepares a quantum state whose support (the set of basis states it is composed of) should ideally have a large overlap with the support of the true ground state. This circuit allows us to quickly project the ansatz onto computational basis states, which will be further used in classical diagonalization. In other words: we don't have to guess an ansatz that is the ground state; we only need it to contain the same basis states. Then classical diagonalization of the projected Hamiltonian will give us the superposition of basis states that best approximates the ground state.\n",
    "#### Step 2: Sample the subspace\n",
    "\n",
    "By sampling from the circuit prepared by the ansatz, we get a collection of bitstrings, $\\{b_j\\}_{j=1}^L$. These bitstrings define the basis of our chosen subspace. The quantum runtime for this step is determined by the depth of the circuit and the number of samples taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Project and diagonalize classically\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the sampled bitstrings, we project the Hamiltonian into the subspace they span. For each pair of bitstrings $(j, k)$, we classically compute the matrix element $\\tilde{H}_{jk} = \\langle b_j | H | b_k \\rangle$. Because Pauli operators are sparse, this step is classically efficient for physical Hamiltonians. The resulting small matrix $\\tilde{H}$ is then diagonalized on a classical processor to estimate the ground state and its energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Optimize the ansatz (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "The process can be made iterative. By treating the estimated ground state energy as a cost function, we can optimize the circuit parameters ($\\theta$) by using methods like gradient descent to improve the ansatz, and in turn, the energy approximation in the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key advantages of SQD\n",
    "\n",
    "SQD offers several powerful features that make it a leading candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Strong robustness to noise: Suppose the true ground state is supported on only two bitstrings. If these are sampled at all, even if their overlap with our ansatz is small, the diagonalization will assign them the appropriate weights and effectively ignore all other extraneous, noisy bitstrings that might have also been sampled. This inherent filtering makes SQD particularly noise-tolerant.\n",
    "* Classical verifiability: Unlike QPE or VQAs, SQD yields a classical approximation to the ground state. This means anyone with access to the list of bitstrings and their weights can recompute and verify the energy estimate directly on a classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQD has already been used to estimate the ground-state dissociation energy of N$_2$ and the electronic properties of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters [[2]](#references), with circuits as large as 77 qubits and 10,570 gates.\n",

    "## SKQD (Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) is another powerful quantum sample-based algorithm that builds upon the principles of SQD. While its goal is the same—to find a good subspace for diagonalization—SKQD employs a more structured method for generating the bitstrings, especially for problems like lattice Hamiltonians.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of SKQD is that instead of optimizing a parameterized circuit to find a good ansatz, one can provably converge to the ground state by sampling from a set of states generated by the system's own natural time evolution - the Krylov subspace. The SKQD algorithm can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Construct the Krylov subspace with time evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins with an initial state $|\\phi_0\\rangle.$ Importantly, we do not need this initial state to have a \"good\" overlap with the ground state. It only needs to be \"polynomially large\", or described by a polynomial in system size. The algorithm itself will then drive the state closer and closer to the ground state of the system. SKQD applies the time evolution operator, $e^{-iHt}$, for different lengths of time. This creates a set of $d$ different quantum states, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\phi_j\\rangle = e^{-i \\,\\delta t j H}|\\phi_0\\rangle,  \\quad \\text{for } j = 0, 1, \\dots, d-1 \\quad \\text{}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of time-evolved states forms a Krylov basis. This step is particularly effective for lattice Hamiltonians where the number of terms in the Hamiltonian is not large. For chemistry problems, this time evolution can result in very deep circuits, which is why SQD is often recommended for those cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Sample from the Krylov basis states\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, bitstring samples are collected from each of the $d$ different states ($|\\phi_0\\rangle, |\\phi_1\\rangle, \\dots, |\\phi_{d-1}\\rangle$) prepared in the previous step. All of these bitstrings are then pooled together to form the basis for the subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Project and diagonalize classically\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is identical to the one in SQD. The collected bitstrings are used to project the full Hamiltonian into the subspace they span. The resulting small matrix, $\\tilde{H}$, is then diagonalized on a classical computer to find the ground state energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key advantages and guarantees of SKQD\n",
    "\n",
    "SKQD's structured approach provides unique benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provable convergence: SKQD's key advantage is its theoretical guarantee of convergence under specific, well-defined conditions. If the true ground state is sparse (can be well-approximated by a polynomial number of bitstrings) and the energy gap to the first excited state is not too small, the method is proven to work efficiently. Under these conditions, SKQD guarantees that it will find the crucial bitstrings that make up the ground state and can approximate the ground state energy to high accuracy. This requires only a polynomial number of quantum experiments and shots. This guarantee places the sample-based approach on a rigorous theoretical footing, similar to established methods like quantum phase estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shared benefits with SQD: Similar to SQD, SKQD also has the noise robustness property. In other words, as long as one has all the good bitstrings in the set of sampled bitstrings, diagonalization assigns almost zero weight to incorrect bitstrings, making the procedure robust to noise. Moreover, since the solution is produced from a classical HPC, the energy of the solution is classically verifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In experiments, SKQD has been used with up to 70 qubits and thousands of gates to study the ground state of complex 4-impurity Anderson models, achieving excellent agreement with state-of-the-art classical methods like DMRG.[[1]](#references)\n",
