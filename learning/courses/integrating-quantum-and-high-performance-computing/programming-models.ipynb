    "Programming models are fundamental specifications that define how software is structured and executed. They provide a framework for developers to express algorithms and organize code, often abstracting away low-level details of the underlying hardware or execution environment. Different models are suited to different types of problems and hardware architectures, offering varying levels of abstraction and control.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will start with the programming model for quantum computers. The fundamental programming model which is familiar to nearly all quantum developers is the quantum circuit. We will not get into the details of the quantum circuit model here, as we already have a great [lecture by John Watrous](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits/introduction) that explains this in detail. We will only mention that the circuit is built out of a set of lines (called wires) that represent qubits, gates that represent operations on quantum states, and a set of measurements.\n",

    "\n",
    "Another important programming model concept for quantum computing is what we call computational primitives. These primitives represent some of the most common tasks that users aim to accomplish with a quantum computer. There are several primitives available at the moment, including [Executor](/docs/guides/directed-execution-model#executor-primitive). In this course we will focus primarily on the primitives Sampler and Estimator. Sampler gives you the ability to sample a state prepared by your quantum circuit. It tells you which computational basis states make up the quantum state prepared on your quantum circuit. Estimator allows you to estimate the expectation value of an observable for a system in the state prepared by your quantum circuit. A common context is estimating the energy of a system in a specific state.\n",

    "The last thing we are going to talk about in this section is transpilation. Transpilation is the process of rewriting a given input circuit to match the physical constraints and Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of a specific quantum device. Similar to classical compilers, this means translating abstract unitary operations into the native gate set that the target device can execute. It also optimizes the circuit instructions for efficient execution on noisy quantum computers, with the routine gradually changing the circuit's structure by applying several optimization stages.\n",

    "## Classical programming models\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many programming models for classical computers, but for this section we will focus on two of the most popular: parallel programming and task workflows. Using these two models alongside quantum programming models, one can express almost any hybrid quantum-classical workflow of any complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parallel programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel programming is a model that divides a program into sub-problems that can be executed simultaneously. There are two main paradigms of parallel programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shared memory parallelism (Open Multiprocessing, or OpenMP) : Used to exploit multiple cores within a single compute node. Threads of execution share a single memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distributed memory parallelism (Message Passing Interface, or MPI): Used for scaling across multiple separate compute nodes. Each process has its own isolated memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll focus on the distributed memory model because it is essential for multi-node supercomputing and coordinating large-scale heterogeneous quantum-classical jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few concepts we need to understand to operate in distributed memory parallel programming models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Process - An independent instance of the program with its own memory space.\n",
    "* Rank - A unique integer identifier assigned to each process, used specifically to identify the sender and receiver during communication (not necessarily a \"rank\" in the sense of prioritizing).\n",
    "* Synchronization - A mechanism for coordination among different ranks and processes.\n",
    "* Single program, multiple data (SPMD) - An abstract computational model where a single source code instance runs simultaneously on multiple processes, each operating on a different subset of the total data.\n",
    "* Message passing - The communication paradigm used in distributed memory architectures that allows independent processes to exchange data and intermediate results. It relies on explicit 'send' and 'receive' operations to coordinate execution between different compute nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a standard called MPI that implements this message passing paradigm for parallel architectures. MPI serves as the functional embodiment of all the concepts listed above, providing the specific library calls necessary to manage processes, assign ranks, facilitate synchronization, and enable message passing under the SPMD model. Gathering all of these concepts together, we can say the execution of a parallel program happens in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single compiled program (the same binary file) is copied to and executed by a job launcher to create multiple parallel processes across multiple nodes.\n",
    "* The main control flow of the program is dictated by the rank of the process. This is the SPMD principle in action: the program uses conditional logic (for example, if (rank == 0)) to ensure that only certain, parallelized sections of the code are executed by the worker processes, while a master process (often Rank 0) handles initialization and final aggregation.\n",
    "* Communication between processes occurs through message passing (using MPI), which is called whenever a process needs to exchange data or intermediate results with another rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, it will look something like this:\n",

    "## Task workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's talk about the Task workflow programming model. A task workflow abstracts computation into a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this graph, each node represents a particular task or job, and the edges (the arrows connecting the nodes) represent the dependencies (data and ordering) between them. A scheduler is the component that maps tasks to resources and orchestrates execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A concrete example of a task workflow model applied to quantum computing is the [Qiskit patterns framework](/docs/guides/intro-to-patterns). A Qiskit pattern is a general framework designed to break down domain-specific problems into a sequence of stages, especially for quantum tasks. This allows for the seamless composability of new capabilities developed by IBM Quantum&reg; researchers (and others) and enables a future in which quantum computing tasks are performed by powerful heterogeneous (CPU/GPU/QPU) computing infrastructure. The four steps of a Qiskit pattern are mapping, optimization, execution, and post-processing, where all tasks are executed one after another in a pipeline. But with task workflows we are not bound to a linear execution order and can execute tasks in parallel. Each task of a workflow can be an entire parallel job of its own. So, you can mix and match these models to describe arbitrarily complex algorithms, and a workload manager like Slurm will handle these.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A diagram of computing tasks organized into a workflow in which some processes are executed in parallel and others in sequence.](/learning/images/courses/integrating-quantum-and-high-performance-computing/programming-models/workflow.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image above illustrates the Qiskit pattern in action. The workflow has a graph structure with four stages. This branch-like structure is orchestrated and executed by the scheduler. The problem is mapped into quantum-executable form (quantum circuit) at the initial stage. In the next stage, this quantum circuit is optimized for the specific quantum hardware. The image shows this as a parallel process, which demonstrates how multiple optimization strategies could be applied at the same time. The optimized quantum circuit is then executed on the actual quantum hardware. This is the third stage of the image where the scheduler works with one purple quantum processing unit. Finally, the results are post-processed by classical resources."

    "### Why both?\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do we need both parallel programming and task workflows? For all the talk about quantum parallelism, it is worth clarifying that not everything is parallel in quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous lesson on the SQD workflow mentioned some processes that cannot be parallelized. For example, we need the results of many quantum measurements in order to project our matrix into a subspace of tractable dimension. In turn, we need the diagonalized matrix and the associated state vectors to check self-consistency of the quantum measurements (using, for example, charge conservation). After all that, we need to decide whether the ground state energy has converged sufficiently for our purposes. These steps are necessarily sequential and require testing of convergence and self-consistency conditions before proceeding.\n",

    "## Programming practice\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of programming models is that you can mix and match them all together. Knowing quantum and classical programming models, you can describe a heterogeneous computation of arbitrary complexity and execute it on hardware. Let's practice this with a small example of a combined workflow, which implements the Qiskit pattern (map, optimize, execute, and post-process) within Slurm that we learned in the last chapter. Each of the four tasks will be a separate Slurm job, each with its own resources. The optimization task will use MPI to optimize circuits in parallel (only for the sake of example, like the above image). The execution task will use quantum resources and quantum programming models (circuit and sampler). The last task - post-processing - will again use MPI in parallel with classical resources."
