# Overview

!["Hero image"](/learning/images/courses/integrating-quantum-and-high-performance-computing/index/hero.svg)

This course provides an overview of classical and quantum resources as well hybrid workflows with examples.

## Recommended background

This course is intended for two distinct groups of individuals: those with backgrounds in quantum computing but not in HPC, and those with backgrounds in HPC but not quantum computing. These technologies complement each other, and those with expertise in one are increasingly aware of the importance of the other. Learners can skip over sections in their own area of expertise as appropriate.

We recommend that learners complete the following prerequisite prior to this course:

- Set up your local environment by following along with the [Get started](/docs/guides/) guide in our documentation page.

For a deeper understanding of quantum information, complete this optional course:
- [Basics of quantum information](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information) with John Watrous.

## Exam

The exam and badge for Integrating quantum and high-performance computing will be available soon. Check back in the next few days.
