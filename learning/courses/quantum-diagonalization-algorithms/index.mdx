# Overview

!["Hero image"](/learning/images/courses/quantum-diagonalization-algorithms/hero.svg)

This course provides an overview of several approaches to quantum diagonalization. Some background is provided on the classical methods that are used, or that motivated the quantum algorithms. The content then steps through the implementation of the quantum algorithms on real quantum computers. There is substantial discussion of what factors determine the scaling of approaches using classical and quantum algorithms.

## Recommended background

This course is intended for individuals who have some experience with quantum computing and want to leverage its power in matrix diagonalization.

We recommend that learners complete the following prerequisites prior to this course:

- Set up your local environment by following along with the [Get started](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides) guide in our documentation page.
- For deeper understanding of quantum information, try [Basics of Quantum Information](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/course/basics-of-quantum-information) with John Watrous.

## Exam

To earn your badge for Quantum diagonalization algorithms, take the exam at IBM Training. This exam is intended to be taken after reading the lessons in this course. After you pass the exam, you will be notified by Credly that you have earned a badge.
