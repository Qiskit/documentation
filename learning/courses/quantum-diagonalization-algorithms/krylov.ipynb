    "\n",
    "Everything that we have described so far can be done classically. So how and when would we use a quantum computer? For very large matrices, the Krylov method can require long computing times and large amounts of memory. The time required for matrix operation of $H$ on $|v\\rangle$ scales like $O(N^2)$ in the worst case. Even multiplying sparse matrices on a vector (the typical case for classical Krylov-type solvers) has a time complexity scaling like $O(N)$. This is done for every vector we want in our subspace. The subspace dimension $r$ is usually not a significant fraction of $N$, and often scales like $\\log(N)$. So generating all vectors scales like $O(N^2 \\log(N))$ in the worst case. Although there are other steps, like orthogonalization, this is the dominant scaling to keep in mind.\n",

We heuristically choose a value for the time-step `dt` (based on upper bounds on the Hamiltonian norm). Ref [\\[9\\]](#references)  showed that a sufficiently small timestep is $\\pi/\\vert \\vert H \\vert \\vert$, and that it is preferable up to a point to underestimate this value rather than overestimate, since overestimating can allow contributions from high-energy states to corrupt even the optimal state in the Krylov space. On the other hand, choosing $dt$ to be too small leads to worse conditioning of the Krylov subspace, since the Krylov basis vectors differ less from timestep to timestep."

In this case, we set the Krylov dimension to be equal to the number of Trotter steps plus one. This is consistent with generating an additional Krylov vector with each application of $U$, plus the initial vector. For the sake of this lesson, we will choose a small Krylov dimension of just 5.

    "\n",
    "Instead of implementing the time-evolution operator exactly we can use the Trotter decomposition to implement an approximation of it. Repeating several times a certain order Trotter decomposition gives us further reduction of the error introduced from the approximation. In the following, we directly build the Trotter implementation in the most efficient way for the interaction graph of the Hamiltonian we are considering (nearest neighbor interactions only). In practice we insert Pauli rotations $R_{xx}$, $R_{yy}$, $R_{zz}$ with a parametrized angle $t$ which correspond to the approximate implementation of $e^{-i (XX + YY + ZZ) t}$. Given the difference in definition of the Pauli rotations and the time-evolution that we are trying to implement, we'll have to use the parameter $2*dt$ to achieve a time-evolution of $dt$. Furthermore, we reverse the order of the operations for odd number of repetitions of the Trotter steps, which is functionally equivalent but allows for synthesizing adjacent operations in a single $SU(2)$ unitary. This gives a much shallower circuit than what is obtained using the generic `PauliEvolutionGate()` functionality."

    "Although we were able to reduce our gate depth by orders of magnitude using the efficient Hadamard test, the depth is still sufficient to require state-of-the-art error mitigation. Below, we specify attributes of the mitigation being used. All of the methods used are important, but it is worth called out [probabilistic error amplification (PEA)](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides/error-mitigation-and-suppression-techniques#probabilistic-error-amplification-pea) specifically. This powerful technique comes with a great deal of quantum overhead. The calculation done here can take 20 minutes or more to run on a real quantum computer. You may wish to play with the parameters below to increase or decrease precision and consequentially overhead. The default settings below yield high-fidelity results."

    "\n",
    "Recall that Hamiltonians generally have terms that cannot be simultaneously measured (because they do not commute with on another). We sort terms in the Hamiltonian into groups of commuting Pauli operators that can all be measured simultaneously, and we may require many such groups to account for all the terms that do not commute with one another. To build up $\\tilde{H}$ on a quantum computer requires separate measurements for each group of commuting Pauli strings in the Hamiltonian, and each of those requires many shots. We must do this for $r^2$ different matrix elements, corresponding to $r^2$ combinations of different time evolution factors. There are sometimes ways to reduce this, but in this rough treatment, the time required for this scales like $N_\\text{shots}\\times N_\\text{GCP} \\times r^2.$ The elements of $S$ must be estimated, which scales like $O(N_\\text{shots}\\times r^2)$. Finally, solving the generalized eigenvalue problem in the projected space, classically, takes $O(r^3).$\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that quantum Krylov diagonalization may be useful in cases where the number of commuting Pauli groups in the Hamiltonian is relatively small. These scaling dependencies suggest some applications where the Krylov method can be useful, and others where it likely will not be.\n",
    "Some Hamiltonians have high complexity when mapped to qubits, involving many non-commuting Pauli strings that cannot easily be partitioned into a few commuting groups. This is often true of quantum chemistry problems, for example. This complexity presents two primary challenges for near-term quantum computers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The estimation of each element of $\\tilde{H}$ becomes computationally expensive due to the large number of terms.\n",
    "* The required Trotter circuits become prohibitively deep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the above points will be less problematic when quantum computers reach fault-tolerance, but they must be considered in the near term. Even systems with âsimplerâ mappings than those in quantum chemistry may experience the same impediments, if the Hamiltonians have too many non-commuting terms.\n",
    "The Krylov method is most useful where the Hamiltonian can be partitioned into relatively few commuting Pauli groups, and where $H$ is easy to implement in trotter circuits. Both of these conditions are satisfied, for example, for many lattice models of interest in physics. KQD is especially useful if very little is known about the ground state. This stems from its inherent convergence guarantees and its applicability in scenarios where alternative methods are untenable due to insufficient ground state knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "While KQD is a powerful tool, the protocol's time-consuming aspects, particularly the estimation of each element of the projected Hamiltonian and the overlap of Krylov states, represent opportunities for improvement. An alternative approach involves leveraging Krylov methods in conjunction with sampling-based methods, which are the subject of the next lesson."
