    "Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) combines classical linear algebra and the power of quantum computing to diagonalize a Hamiltonian (matrix) and compute its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Matrix diagonalization is an important mathematical operation as many problems in science, computation and optimization use the method.\n",

    "## 1. Introduction and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the energy eigenvalue equation made famous by Schrödinger, as an example.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H \\vert \\psi \\rangle = E \\vert \\psi \\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$H$ is the Hamiltonian of a system, $|\\psi\\rangle$ is the wave function (also known as the eigenstate), and $E$ is an eigenvalue. The eigenvalues of matrix $H$ represent the energy levels of the system. For example, if the system is a molecule, the lowest eigenvalue represents the ground state energy of the molecule. In many problems, we are interested in ground state energy estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying exact diagonalization techniques from linear algebra, we can diagonalize the full $H$ matrix. However, the approach becomes computationally expensive (even impossible) as the matrix gets larger. For example, even for small chemical molecules, $H$ can be prohibitively large (for example, Hamiltonian for the $N_2$ molecule with a cc-PVDZ basis has a dimension of $65780 \\times 65780).$\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we do not always need all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian $H$, and therefore, diagonalization of the full matrix is not required in many practical cases. For example, in case of ground state estimation, we are interested in the lowest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector. This allows us to apply the concept of projection onto a (useful) subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an $N \\times N$ matrix, $H$, where the complete vector space (Hilbert space) has a dimension of $N$ ($N$ is large). Next, we select a subspace ($\\mathcal{S}$) - which is a subset of the full Hilbert space - of dimension $M$, where $M$ is sufficiently small. After projecting $H$ onto this subspace, the projected matrix (say, $H_\\mathcal{S}$) will be smaller ($M \\times M$). The smaller $H_\\mathcal{S}$ can be diagonalized using a suitable classical numerical method, and generate eigenvalues and eigenvectors for that subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the subspace must be in _support_ of our target (for example, ground) eigenstate.** In other words, the projected Hamiltonian $H_\\mathcal{S}$ must be in a subspace that includes the lowest eigenvalue."

    "\n",
    "Ideally, the set of basis vectors for this states consists of $\\{ \\vert 000 \\rangle, \\vert 111 \\rangle \\}$ (in other words, the subspace of this state is spanned by these two basis vectors).\n",

However, earlier we have shown that including such vectors in the subspace is not problematic as the projection and diagonalization operation sets the amplitude of unwanted vectors to $0$, and we can get expected eigenvalue and reconstruct the correct eigenstate.\n",

    "It can be tempting to draw samples from a uniform distribution to span the subspace. While it may work for small problems, it will start to fail for larger and more practical problems. For large problems with many qubits, the Hilbert space can be prohibitively large. For example, a 32-qubit Hilbert space has more than $4$ billion possible basis vectors ($2^{32} = 4,294,967,296$). If we uniformly sample from that space with finite sample budget (say $10000$ vectors to keep the diagonalization process feasible), the subspace may exclude vectors with ground state support more often as the process will be random. **Therefore, we need a systematic way to sample from ground state support leveraging quantum circuits.**"

    "| Measurement overhead        |   **Many Pauli terms, many measurement circuits:** The Hamiltonian for the molecule has $2951$ unique Pauli terms. As the Pauli terms can contain $X$ and $Y$ terms, and typical quantum measurements are done in the $Z$-basis, we need measurement basis change to evaluate those terms. When optimized for measurements, the $2951$ terms can be grouped into $1187$ groups, where each group can be evaluated using a single circuit. Thus, we need at least $1187$ unique circuits to evaluate all Pauli terms. **Many shots per circuit for tighter variance**. Again, the evaluated expectation value of each Pauli term has a variance attached to them which depends inversely on the $\\sqrt{shots}$. Therefore, to accurately estimate each term, we need to allocate many shots per circuit. For example, to achieve chemical accuracy ($1$ kcal/mol), typically we need shots in the order of $10^5$-$10^7$ per circuit. Thus, VQE needs many measurement circuits and each circuit with certain number of shots. For practical cases, this measurement overhead can be restrictive. | In SQD, we do not need different measurement circuits for each grouped Pauli terms. Typically, we measure a single circuit for a fixed number of shots. While we may set the number of shots to a large value depending on the problem, the overhead remains much smaller than VQE. Also, the energy estimations using diagonalization process are exact, meaning the computed eigenvalues are exact in that subspace and does not have a variance attached to them like VQE. (In case of Krylov basis state sampling (Lesson 5), we need to measure multiple circuits, but the number circuit remains much smaller than VQE). |\n",
    "| Estimated energy bound           |   In VQE, energy estimations are not bounded and can be lower than true minimum values due to noise.  | The energy estimation process in SQD always produces upper bound to ground state energy and estimated energy will never be lower than the true ground state energy. |\n",
    "| Noise tolerance    |  VQE energy estimation is susceptible to noise from pre-fault-tolerant quantum computers. | SQD has inherent tolerance to noise. Pre-fault-tolerant quantum computers can produce noisy samples. Even if we include those samples in the subspace, the subsequent diagonalization can suppress those samples by setting their amplitudes to zero. Also, we will discuss a method called _configuration recovery_ in relation to SQD that improves SQD noise tolerance further. |"
