This family of quantum circuits can prepare a family of quantum states approximating the ground state.\n",

Sometimes what we really care about is simply this expectation value, which we call a cost function.

    "\n",
    "At the core of a VQE problem is an operator that describes a system of interest. We will assume here that the lowest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector of this operator are useful for some scientific or business purpose. Examples might include a chemical Hamiltonian describing a molecule, such that the lowest eigenvalue of the operator corresponds to the ground state energy of the molecule, and the corresponding eigenstate describes the geometry or electron configuration of the molecule. Or the operator could describe a cost of a certain process to be optimized, and the eigenstates could correspond to routes or practices. In some fields, like physics, a \"Hamiltonian\" almost always refers to an operator describing the energy of a physical system. But in quantum computing, it is common to see quantum operators that describe a business or logistical problem also referred to as a \"Hamiltonian\". We will adopt that convention here.\n",

But we typically also want the configuration that yields that lowest energy or eigenvalue. So the next step is the estimation of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, which is accomplished through quantum measurements. A lot goes into that. But we can understand this process qualitatively by noting that the probability $P_j$ of measuring an energy $E_j$ (again using the language of physical systems) is related to the expectation value by:\n",

    "But let’s talk about reasons why this might not be efficient. One reason for many measurements is to reduce the statistical uncertainty in your estimates, for very high-precision calculations. Another reason is the number of Pauli strings required to span your entire matrix. Because Pauli matrices (plus the identity: X, Y, Z, and I) span the space of all operators of a given dimension, we are guaranteed that we can write our matrix of interest as a weighted sum of Pauli operators, as we did before.\n",

Recall that Qiskit uses *little endian* notation, in which the $n^\\text{th}$ Pauli operator from the right acts on the $n^\\text{th}$ qubit. So we can measure our operator by measuring a series of Pauli operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we cannot measure all those Pauli operators simultaneously. Pauli operators (excluding I) do not commute with each other if they are associated with the same qubit. For example, we can measure `IZIZ` and `ZZXZ` simultaneously, because we can measure I and Z simultaneously for the 3rd qubit, and we can know I and X simultaneously for the 1st qubit. But we cannot measure ZZZZ and ZZZX simultaneously, because Z and X do not commute, and both act on the 0th qubit.\n",

If $N_\\text{GCP}$ is small, this could work well. If $H$ has millions of groups, this will not be useful.\n",

To learn more about Estimator, see the [API reference](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/estimator-v2) in IBM Quantum Documentation. One can simply use Estimator directly, but Estimator returns much more than just the lowest energy eigenvalue. For example, it also returns information on ensemble standard error. Thus, in the context of minimization problems, one often sees Estimator inside a cost function.

For each such Hamiltonian produced and mapped onto qubits, we would need to carry out optimization like that done above. Of all those many converged optimization problems, the geometry that produced the lowest energy would be the one adopted by nature. This is quite a bit more involved than what was shown above.

    "## 4. VQE's relationship to other methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will review the advantages and disadvantages of the original VQE approach and point out its relationships to other, more recent algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 The strengths and weaknesses of VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "Some strengths have already been pointed out. They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suitability to modern hardware: Some quantum algorithms require much lower error rates, approaching large scale fault tolerance. VQE does not; it can be implemented on current quantum computers.\n",
    "* Shallow circuits: VQE often employs relatively shallow quantum circuits. This makes VQE less susceptible to accumulated gate errors and makes it suitable for many error mitigation techniques. Of course, the circuits are not always shallow; this depends on the ansatz used.\n",
    "* Versatility: VQE can (in principle) be applied to any problem that can be cast as an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem. There are many caveats that make VQE impractical or disadvantageous for some problems. Some of these are recapped below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some weaknesses of VQE and problems for which it is impractical have also been described above. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heuristic nature: VQE does not guarantee convergence to the correct ground state energy, as its performance depends on the choice of ansatz and optimization methods[\\[1-2\\]](#references). If a poor ansatz is chosen that lacks the requisite entanglement for the desired ground state, no classical optimizer can reach that ground state.\n",
    "* Potentially numerous parameters: A very expressive ansatz may have so many parameters that the minimization iterations are very time-consuming.\n",
    "* High measurement overhead: In VQE, an estimator is used to estimate the expectation value of each term in the Hamiltonian. Most Hamiltonians of interest will have terms that cannot be simultaneously estimated. This can make VQE resource-intensive for large systems with complicated Hamiltonians[\\[1\\]](#references).\n",
    "* Effects of noise: When the classical optimizer is searching for a minimum, noisy calculations can confuse it and steer it away from the true minimum or delay its convergence. One possible solution for this is leveraging IBM's state of the art error mitigation and error suppression techniques[\\[2-3\\]](#references).\n",
    "* Barren plateaus: These regions of vanishing gradients[\\[2-3\\]](#references) exist even in the absence of noise, but noise makes them more troublesome since the change in expectation values due to noise could be larger than the change from updating parameters in these barren regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Relationship to other approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adapt-VQE\n",
    "\n",
    "The **ADAPT-VQE** (Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter Variational Quantum Eigensolver) algorithm is an enhancement of the original VQE algorithm, designed to improve efficiency, accuracy, and scalability for quantum simulations, particularly in quantum chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original VQE algorithm described throughout this lesson uses a predefined, fixed ansatz to approximate the ground state of the system. In our case, we used EfficientSU2, with a single repetition, using Y and RZ rotation gates.  Although the parameters in the RZ gates changed, the structure of this ansatz and the gates used did not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAPT-VQE addresses the limitations of VQE through adaptive ansatz construction. Instead of starting with a fixed ansatz, ADAPT-VQE dynamically builds the ansatz iteratively. At each step, it selects the operator from a predefined pool (such as fermionic excitation operators) that has the largest gradient with respect to the energy. This ensures that only the most impactful operators are added, leading to a compact and efficient ansatz[\\[4-6\\]](#references). This approach can have several beneficial effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Circuit Depth**: By growing the ansatz incrementally and focusing only on necessary operators, ADAPT-VQE minimizes gate operations compared to traditional VQE approaches[\\[5,7\\]](#references).\n",
    "2. **Improved Accuracy**: The adaptive nature allows ADAPT-VQE to recover more correlation energy at each step, making it particularly effective for strongly correlated systems where traditional VQE struggles[\\[8,9\\]](#references).\n",
    "3. **Scalability and Noise Robustness**: The compact ansatz reduces the accumulation of gate errors, reduces computational overhead, and limits the number of variational parameters which must be minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "ADAPT-VQE is still not perfect. In some cases it can become trapped or slowed by local minima, and it may suffer from over-parameterization. It can also be fairly resource intensive, since it requires the calculation of gradients and parameter optimization with many gate structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantum phase estimation (QPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "QPE is similar in purpose to VQE, but very different in implementation. QPE requires fault-tolerant quantum computers due to its generally deep quantum circuits and the high level of coherence it requires. Once QPE can be implemented, it would be more precise than VQE. One way of describing the difference is through the precision as a function of circuit depth. QPE achieves precision $\\epsilon$ with circuit depths scaling as $O(1/\\epsilon)$ [\\[10\\]](#references). VQE requires $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ samples to achieve the same precision[\\[10,11\\]](#references).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Krylov, SQD, QSCI & others in this course\n",
    "\n",
    "VQE helped establish quantum algorithms that still depend on classical computers, not just for operating the quantum computer, but for substantial parts of the algorithm. Several such algorithms are the focus of the remainder of this course. Here, we give a cursory explanation of a few, simply to compare and contrast them to VQE. They will be explained in much greater detail in subsequent lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Krylov quantum diagonalization (KQD)__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Krylov subspace methods__ are ways of projecting a matrix onto a subspace to reduce its dimension and make it more manageable, while keeping the most important features. One trick in this method is to generate a subspace that keeps these features; it turns out that generating this subspace is closely related to a well-established method on quantum computers called __Trotterization__.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few variants of quantum Krylov methods, but generally the approach is:\n",
    "* Use the quantum computer to generate a subspace (the Krylov subspace) through Trotterization\n",
    "* Project the matrix of interest onto that Krylov subspace\n",
    "* Diagonalize the new projected Hamiltonian using a classical computer\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sampling-based quantum diagonalization (SQD)__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sampling-based quantum diagonalization (SQD)__ is related to the Krylov method in that it also attempts to reduce the dimension of a matrix to be diagonalized while preserving key features. SQD does this in the following way:\n",
    "* Begin with an initial guess for your ground state and prepare the system in that ground state.\n",
    "* Use Sampler to sample the bitstrings that make up this state.\n",
    "* Use the collection of computational basis states from sampler as the subspace onto which you project your matrix of interest.\n",
    "* Diagonalize the smaller, projected matrix using a classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is related to VQE in that it leverages classical and quantum computing for substantial algorithm components. They both also share the requirement that we prepare a good initial guess or ansatz. But the distribution of work between the classical and quantum computers in SQD is more like that of the Krylov method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the Krylov method and SQD have recently been combined into the sampling-based Krylov quantum diagonalization (SKQD) method [\\[12\\]](#references).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Quantum subspace configuration interaction (QSCI)__\n",
    "\n",
    "[__Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI)__](/docs/guides/qunasys-quri-chemistry)[\\[13\\]](#references) is an algorithm that produces an approximated ground state of a Hamiltonian by sampling a trial wave function to identify the significant computational basis states to generate a subspace for a classical diagonalization.\n",
    "Both SQD and QSCI use a quantum computer to construct a reduced subspace.  QSCI's additional strength is in its state preparation, especially in the context of chemistry problems. It leverages various strategies such as using time-evolved states [\\[14\\]](#references) and a set of chemistry-inspired ansätze. By focusing on efficient state preparation, QSCI reduces quantum computational costs for chemical Hamiltonians while maintaining high fidelity and leveraging the noise robustness from quantum state sampling techniques [\\[15\\]](#references). QSCI also provides an [adaptive construction technique](/docs/guides/qunasys-quri-chemistry#optimization-based-qsci) which provides more ansätze for a better result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default workflow of QSCI for chemistry problem is as follows:\n",
    "* Build the molecular Hamiltonian using your software of choice (such as SciPy).\n",
    "* Prepare a QSCI algorithm by selecting a proper initial state and a chemistry-inspired ansatz with a pre-selected set of parameters.\n",
    "* Sample significant basis states and diagonalize the Hamiltonian using a classical computer to obtain the ground state energy.\n",
    "* Often one uses configuration recovery [\\[16\\]](#references) and symmetry post-selection [\\[15\\]](#references) as a post processing technique.\n",
    "* Optionally, the workflow of adaptive QSCI has an additional optimization loop from step2 to step3, by using more ansätze with a random initial states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check-in question\n",
    "\n",
    "What does VQE have in common with all the other methods listed above (except QPE which is not described in great detail)?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer:__\n",
    "\n",
    "All involve a trial state or wave function of some sort. All work best when the initial guess for this trial state is excellent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another correct answer is that they are all easiest to implement when the Hamiltonian is easy to measure (can be sorted into relatively few groups of commuting Pauli operators).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check-in question\n",
    "\n",
    "What does VQE have in common with none of the other methods listed above?\n",
