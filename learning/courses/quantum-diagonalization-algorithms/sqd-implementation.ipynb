    "In this lesson, we will use Jordan-Wigner (JW) transformation to map a fermionic wavefunction to a qubit wavefunction so that it can be prepared using a quantum circuit. The JW transformation maps the Fock space of fermions in M spatial orbitals onto the Hilbert space of 2M qubits, i.e., a spatial orbital is split into two _spin orbitals_, one associated with a spin up ($\\alpha$) electron and another with spin down ($\\beta$). A spin orbital can be occupied or unoccupied. Usually, when we refer to number of orbitals, we will be using number of _spatial_ orbitals. The number of spin orbitals will be double. In quantum circuits, we will represent each spin orbital with one qubit. Thus, a set of qubits will represent spin-up or $\\alpha$-orbitals, and another set will represent spin-up or $\\beta$-orbitals. For example, $N_2$ molecule for `6-31g` basis set has $16$ spatial orbitals (i.e., $16$ $\\alpha$ + $16$ $\\beta$ = $32$ spin orbitals). Thus, we will need a $32$-qubit quantum circuit (we may need extra ancilla qubits as discussed later). The qubits are measured in computational basis to generate bitstrings, which represent electronic configurations or (Slater) determinants. Throughout this lesson, we will use the terms bitstrings, configurations, and determinants interchangeably. The bitstrings tell us electron occupancy in spin orbitals: a $1$ in a bit position means the corresponding spin orbital is occupied, while a $0$ means the spin orbital is empty. As electronic structure problems are particle preserving, only a fixed number of spin orbitals must be occupied. The $N_2$ molecule has $5$ spin-up ($\\alpha$) and $5$ spin-down ($\\beta$) electrons. Thus, any bitstring representing the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ orbitals must have five $1\\text{s}$ each for $N_2$ molecule."

    "The first plot shows that after a few iterations we estimate the ground state energy within ~24 mH (chemical accuracy is typically accepted to be 1 kcal/mol $\\approx$ 1.6 mH). The second plot shows the average occupancy of each spatial orbital after the final iteration. We can see that both the spin-up and spin-down electrons occupy the first five orbitals with high probability in our solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the estimated ground state energy is decent, it is not within the chemical accuracy limit ($\\pm \\approx 1.6$ mH). This gap can be attributed to the small subspace dimension we used above for projection and diagonalization. As we used `samples_per_batch=500`, the subspace is spanned by max $500$ vectors, which is missing vectors from ground state support. Increasing the `samples_per_batch` parameter should improve the accuracy at the expense of more classical compute resources and runtime."
