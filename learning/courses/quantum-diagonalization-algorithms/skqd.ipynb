    "An important step in the sample-based quantum diagonalization method is to generate quality vectors for the subspace. In the previous lesson, we used the LUCJ ansatz to generate subspace vectors for a chemistry Hamiltonian. In this lesson, we will use quantum Krylov states[\\[1\\]](#references) as was discussed in lesson 2. First, we will review how to create the Krylov space on a quantum computer using time evolution operations. We will then sample from it. We will project the system Hamiltonian onto the sampled subspace and diagonalize it to estimate the ground state energy. The algorithm provably and efficiently converges to the ground state, under the assumptions described in lesson 2.\n",

Instead, we can use the time-evolution operator $U = e^{-iH(dt)}$ which can be shown to give similar [convergence guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07492) as the power Krylov space.

On the other hand, choosing $dt$ to be too small leads to worse conditioning of the Krylov subspace, since the Krylov basis vectors differ less from timestep to timestep. In addition, while this choice of $dt$ is provably adequate for convergence of SKQD, in this sampling-based context the optimal choice of $dt$ in practice is a topic of ongoing study. In this lesson, we set $dt = 0.15$.\n",

    "There may be other valid answers, but complete answers should include the following:\n",
    "(a) SKQD comes with convergence guarantees that SQD does not. In SQD you either need to make a very good guess for your ansatz that has excellent overlap with the ground state support in the computational basis, or you need to introduce a variational component to the calculation to sample a family of ansaetze.\n",
    "(b) SKQD requires much less QPU time, because it avoids the costly calculation of matrix elements via the Hadamard test."

    "## 5. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ground state energy estimations via sampling Krylov basis states is very well-suited to lattice models including spin systems, condensed matter problems, and lattice gauge theories. This approach scales much better than VQE, because it does not require optimization over many parameters in a variational ansatz as in VQE, or in heuristic ansatz-based SQD (e.g., the chemistry problem in the previous lesson).\n",
    "    - To keep circuit depths low, it is wise to address lattice problems which are amenable to pre-fault tolerant hardware.\n",
    "- SKQD does not incur a quantum measurement problem like in VQE. There are no groups of commuting Pauli operators to be estimated.\n",
    "- SKQD is robust to noisy samples as one can use a problem-specific post-selection routine (for example, filter out bitstrings that do not adhere to problem-specific patterns) or incur classical diagonalization overhead (i.e., diagonalize in a larger subspace) to effectively remove the effect of noise."
