    "\n",
    "One of the main issues with VQE is the multiple calls to a quantum computer that are required to obtain the parameters for each step, including $k$, $k-1$, etc. This is especially problematic when access to quantum devices is queued. While a [`Session`](https://docs.quantum-computing.ibm.com/run/sessions) can be used to group multiple iterative calls, an alternative approach is to use sampling. By utilizing more classical resources, we can complete the full optimization process in a single call. This is where [Quantum Sampling Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02338) comes into play. Since access to quantum computers is still a low-offer/high-demand commodity, we find this trade-off to be both possible and convenient for many current studies. This approach harnesses all available classical capabilities while still capturing many of the inner workings and intrinsic properties of quantum computations that do not appear in simulation.\n",
