    "Variational algorithms include several modular components that can be combined and optimized based on algorithm, software, and hardware advancements. This includes a *cost function* that describes a specific problem with a set of parameters, an *ansatz* to express the search space with these parameters, and an *optimizer* to iteratively explore the search space. During each iteration, the optimizer evaluates the [cost function][cost] with the current parameters and selects the next iteration's parameters until it [converges][converge] on an optimal solution. The hybrid nature of this family of algorithms comes from the fact that the cost functions are evaluated using quantum resources and optimized through classical ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize problem**: Variational algorithms start by initializing the quantum computer in a _default state_ $|0\\rangle$, then transforming it to some desired (non-parametrized) state $|\\rho\\rangle$, which we will call _reference state_.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This transformation is represented by the application of a unitary reference operator $U_R$ on the default state, such that $U_R|0\\rangle = |\\rho\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prepare ansatz**: To begin iteratively optimizing from the default state $|0\\rangle$ to the target state $|\\psi(\\vec\\theta)\\rangle$, we must define a *variational form* $U_V(\\vec\\theta)$ to represent a collection of parametrized states for our variational algorithm to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "   We refer to any particular combination of reference state and variational form as an ansatz, such that: $U_A(\\vec\\theta) := U_V(\\vec\\theta) U_R$. Ansatze will ultimately take the form of parametrized quantum circuits capable of taking the default state $|0\\rangle$ to the target state $|\\psi(\\vec\\theta)\\rangle$.\n",

While this can be information about a physical system, such as energy or spin, we can also encode non-physical problems as well. We can leverage Qiskit Runtime primitives to address noise with error suppression and mitigation while evaluating our cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize parameters**: Evaluations are taken to a classical computer, where a classical optimizer analyzes them and chooses the next set of values for the variational parameters. If we have a pre-existing optimal solution, we can set it as an *initial point* $\\vec\\theta_0$ to *bootstrap* our optimization. Using this *initial state* $|\\psi(\\vec\\theta_0)\\rangle$ could help our optimizer find a valid solution faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adjust ansatz parameters with results, and re-run**: The  entire process is repeated until the classical optimizer's finalization criteria are met, and an optimal set of parameter values $\\vec\\theta^*$ is returned. The proposed solution state for our problem will then be $|\\psi(\\vec\\theta^*)\\rangle = U_A(\\vec\\theta^*)|0\\rangle$.\n",
