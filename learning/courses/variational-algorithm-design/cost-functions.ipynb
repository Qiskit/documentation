For example, a car on a road can have a certain mass, position, speed, or acceleration that characterize its state. Similarly, quantum systems can also have different configurations or states, but they differ from classical systems in how we deal with measurements and state evolution. This leads to unique properties such as *superposition* and *entanglement* that are exclusive to quantum mechanics. Just like we can describe a car's state using physical properties like speed or acceleration, we can also describe the state of a quantum system using *observables*, which are mathematical objects.\n",

This is important if queue times are long and/or many iterations are needed. Only partners in the IBM Quantum Network can use Runtime sessions. If you do not have access to sessions, you can reduce the number of iterations you submit at a given time, and save the most recent parameters for use in future runs.

    "[Error mitigation](/docs/guides/error-mitigation) refers to techniques that allow users to reduce circuit errors by modeling the device noise at the time of execution.

    "\n",
    "The Qiskit Runtime primitive's `resilience_level` option specifies the amount of resilience to build against errors. Higher levels generate more accurate results at the expense of longer processing times due to quantum sampling overhead. Resilience levels can be used to configure the trade-off between cost and accuracy when applying error mitigation to your primitive query.\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing any error mitigation technique, we expect the [bias][bias] in our results to be reduced with respect to the previous, unmitigated bias. In some cases, the bias may even disappear. However, this comes at a cost. As we reduce the bias in our estimated quantities, the statistical variability will increase (that is, variance), which we can account for by further increasing the number of shots per circuit in our sampling process. This will introduce overhead beyond that needed to reduce the bias, so it is not done by default. We can easily opt-in to this behavior by adjusting the number of shots per circuit in options.executions.shots, as shown in the example below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's how to calculate an expectation value while using error mitigation and suppression in Qiskit Runtime. We can make use of precisely the same circuit and observable as before, but this time keeping the optimization level fixed at level 2, and now tuning the _resilience_ or the error mitigation technique(s) being used. This error mitigation process occurs multiple times throughout an optimization loop.\n",
