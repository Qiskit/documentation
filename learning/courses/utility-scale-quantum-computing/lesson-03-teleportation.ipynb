    "\n",
    "To solve any utility-scale quantum problem, we will need to move information around on a quantum computer from one qubit to another. There are well-known protocols for doing this, but some of the most foundational were cast in the context of sending information between distant parties. Throughout this lesson, we will sometimes use language consistent with this context, such as \"distant friends sending information\". But keep in mind that these protocols have broader significance in quantum computing. In this lesson we consider the following quantum communication protocols:\n",
    "- **Quantum teleportation**\n",
    "    Using a shared entangled state (sometimes called an e-bit) to send an unknown quantum state to a distant friend, requiring supplemental classical communication.\n",
    "- **Quantum superdense coding**\n",
    "    How to send two bits of information by sending a single qubit to a distant friend (again using prior shared entangled qubits).\n",

    "## 4. Quantum teleportation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider the situation when a character Alice wants to send an unknown quantum state $|\\psi \\rangle$ to her friend Bob, who is far away. Assume they can only communicate with classical communication (like using email or a phone). Alice cannot copy the quantum state (due to the no-cloning theorem). If she repeated the same preparation process many times, she could build up statistics as we just did. But what if there is only a single unknown state? This state might have emerged from a physical process you want to study. Or it could be part of a larger quantum computation. In that case, how could Alice send the state to Bob? She can, if she and Bob share a valuable quantum resource: a shared entangled state, like the Bell state introduced in the previous lesson: $\\frac {|00\\rangle + |11\\rangle}{\\sqrt 2}.$ You may sometimes also see this referred to as an \"EPR pair\" or an \"e-bit\" (a fundamental unit of entanglement). If Alice shares such an entangled state with Bob, she can *teleport* the unknown quantum state to Bob by performing a series of quantum operations and sending him two bits of classical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 The protocol of Quantum teleportation\n",
    "**Assumption**: Alice has an unknown quantum state $|\\psi \\rangle$ to be sent to Bob. Alice and Bob shares a 2-qubit entangled state, or e-bit, each having one of the qubits physically at their location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we outline the procedure without explanation. These will be implemented in detail below.\n",
    "1. Alice entangles $|\\psi \\rangle$  with her part of the e-bit using the CNOT gate.\n",
    "2. Alice applies a Hadamard gate to $|\\psi \\rangle$, and measures both her qubits in the computational basis.\n",
    "3. Alice sends Bob her measurement results (either “00”, “01”, “10”, or “11”)\n",
    "4. Bob performs a *correction* operator based on Alice’s two-bit of information on his part of the e-bit pair.\n",
    "    - If “00”, Bob does nothing\n",
    "    - If “01”, Bob applies X gate\n",
    "    - If “10”, Bob applies Z gate\n",
    "    - If “11”, Bob applies iY = ZX gate\n",
    "5. Bob's part of the e-bit becomes $|\\psi \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also worked out in more detail in [Basics of Quantum Information](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/entanglement-in-action/quantum-teleportation). But the situation will become more clear as we instantiate this in Qiskit."
