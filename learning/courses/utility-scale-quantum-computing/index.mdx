# Overview

!["Hero image"](/learning/images/courses/utility-scale-quantum-computing/hero.svg)

This event replay course consists of 14 lessons and labs developed and run by IBM Quantum&reg; in collaboration with the University of Tokyo. These lessons cover a wide variety of important topics in quantum computing, but they are focused on building toward a utility-scale calculation. The result is very similar to work published on the cover of Nature in June 2023.
