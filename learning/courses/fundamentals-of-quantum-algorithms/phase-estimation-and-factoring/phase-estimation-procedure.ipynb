    "Next we'll discuss the *phase-estimation procedure*, which is a quantum algorithm for solving the phase estimation problem.\n",

    "We'll begin with a low-precision warm-up, which explains some of the basic intuition behind the method.\n",
    "We'll then talk about the *quantum Fourier transform*, which is an important quantum operation used in the phase-estimation procedure, as well as its quantum circuit implementation.\n",
    "Once we have the quantum Fourier transform in hand, we'll describe the phase-estimation procedure in full generality and analyze its performance.\n",

    "## Warm-up: approximating phases with low precision\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with a couple of simple versions of the phase-estimation procedure that provide low-precision solutions to the phase-estimation problem.\n",
    "This is helpful for explaining the intuition behind the general procedure that we'll see a bit later in the lesson.\n",

    "### Using the phase kickback\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple approach to the phase-estimation problem, which allows us to learn something about the value $\\theta$ we seek, is based on the *phase kick-back* phenomenon.\n",
    "As we'll see, this is essentially a single-qubit version of the general phase-estimation procedure to be discussed later in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the input to the phase estimation problem, we have a unitary quantum circuit for the operation $U.$\n",
    "We can use the description of this circuit to create a circuit for a *controlled*-$U$ operation, which can be depicted as this figure suggests (with the operation $U,$ viewed as a quantum gate, on the left and a controlled-$U$ operation on the right).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Uncontrolled and controlled versions of a unitary operation](/learning/images/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/phase-estimation-and-factoring/uncontrolled-and-controlled-unitary.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a quantum circuit for a controlled-$U$ operation by first adding a control qubit to the circuit for $U,$ and then replacing every gate in the circuit for $U$ with a controlled version of that gate — so our one new control qubit effectively controls every single gate in the circuit for $U.$\n",
    "This requires that we have a controlled version of every gate in our circuit, but we can always build circuits for these controlled operations in case they're not included in our gate set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the following circuit, where the input state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ of all of the qubits except the top one is the quantum state eigenvector of $U.$\n",

    "\n",
    "It's natural to ask what role the two Hadamard gates play in this procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    " - The first Hadamard gate sets the control qubit to a uniform superposition of $\\vert 0\\rangle$ and $\\vert 1\\rangle,$ so that when the phase kickback occurs, it happens for the $\\vert 1\\rangle$ state and not the $\\vert 0\\rangle$ state, creating a *relative* phase difference that affects the measurement outcomes. If we didn't do this and the phase kickback produced a *global* phase, it would have no effect on the probabilities of obtaining different measurement outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The second Hadamard gate allows us to learn something about the number $\\theta$ through the phenomenon of *interference*. Prior to the second Hadamard gate, the state of the top qubit is\n",

    "   \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\vert 0\\rangle + \\frac{e^{2\\pi i \\theta}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\vert 1\\rangle,\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   and if we were to measure this state, we would obtain $0$ and $1$ each with probability $1/2,$ telling us nothing about $\\theta.$ By performing the second Hadamard gate, however, we cause the number $\\theta$ to affect the output probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Doubling the phase\n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit above uses the phase kickback phenomenon to approximate $\\theta$ to a single bit of accuracy.\n",
    "One bit of accuracy may be all we need in some situations — but for factoring we're going to need a lot more accuracy than that.\n",
    "A natural question is, how can we learn more about $\\theta?$\n",
    "\n",
    "One very simple thing we can do is to replace the controlled-$U$ operation in our circuit with *two copies* of this operation, like in this circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Single-bit phase estimation doubled](/learning/images/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/phase-estimation-and-factoring/double-phase-kickback.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two copies of a controlled-$U$ operation is equivalent to a controlled-$U^2$ operation.\n",
    "If $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $U$ having eigenvalue $\\lambda = e^{2\\pi i \\theta},$ then this state is also an eigenvector of $U^2,$ this time having eigenvalue $\\lambda^2 = e^{2\\pi i (2\\theta)}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we run this version of the circuit, we're effectively performing the same computation as before, except that the number $\\theta$ is replaced by $2\\theta.$\n",
    "Here's a plot illustrating the output probabilities as $\\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $1.$\n",
    "\n",
    "![Outcome probabilities from double-phase kickback](/learning/images/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/phase-estimation-and-factoring/double-kickback-probabilities.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this can indeed provide us with some additional information about $\\theta.$\n",
    "If the binary representation of $\\theta$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta = 0.a_1 a_2 a_3\\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then doubling $\\theta$ effectively shifts the binary point one position to the right:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2\\theta = a_1. a_2 a_3\\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And because we're equating $\\theta = 1$ with $\\theta = 0$ as we move around the unit circle, we see that the bit $a_1$ has no influence on our probabilities, and we're effectively obtaining a guess for the *second* bit after the binary point if we round $\\theta$ to two bits.\n",
    "For instance, if we knew in advance that $\\theta$ was either $0$ or $1/4,$ then we could fully trust the measurement outcome to tell us which.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not immediately clear, though, how this estimation should be reconciled with what we learned from the original (non-doubled) phase kickback circuit to give us the most accurate information possible about $\\theta.$\n",

    "\n",
    "If we run this circuit when $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $U,$ the state of the bottom qubits will remain $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ throughout the entire circuit, and phases will be \"kicked\" into the state of the top two qubits.\n",
