    "Now we'll turn our attention to the integer factorization problem, and see how it can be solved efficiently on a quantum computer using phase estimation.\n",
    "The algorithm we'll obtain is *Shor's algorithm for integer factorization*.\n",
    "Shor didn't describe his algorithm specifically in terms of phase estimation, but it is a natural and intuitive way to explain how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by discussing an intermediate problem known as the *order-finding problem* and see how phase estimation provides a solution to this problem.\n",
    "We'll then see how an efficient solution to the order-finding problem gives us an efficient solution to the integer factorization problem.\n",
    "(When a solution to one problem provides a solution to another problem like this, we say that the second problem *reduces* to the first — so in this case we're reducing integer factorization to order finding.)\n",
    "This second part of Shor's algorithm doesn't make use of quantum computing at all; it's completely classical.\n",

    "### Some basic number theory\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain the order-finding problem and how it can be solved using phase estimation, it will be helpful to begin with a couple of basic number theory concepts, and to introduce some handy notation along the way.\n",

    "$\\mathbb{Z}_3 = \\{0,1,2\\},\\;$\n",
    "and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are sets of numbers, but we can think of them as more than sets.\n",
    "In particular, we can think about *arithmetic operations* on $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ such as addition and multiplication — and if we agree to always take our answers modulo $N$\n",
    "(that is, divide by $N$ and take the remainder as the result), we'll always stay within this set when we perform these operations.\n",
    "The two specific operations of addition and multiplication, both taken modulo $N,$ turn $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ into a *ring*, which is a fundamentally important type of object in algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $3$ and $5$ are elements of $\\mathbb{Z}_7,$ and if we multiply them together we get $3\\cdot 5 = 15,$ which leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $7.$\n",
    "Sometimes we express this as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to the quantum circuit itself, there are a few classical computations that need to be performed along the way.\n",
    "This includes computing the powers $a^k$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ for $k = 2, 4, 8, \\ldots, 2^{m-1},$ which are needed to create the controlled-unitary gates, as well as the continued fraction algorithm that converts approximations of $\\theta$ into fractions.\n",
    "These computations can be performed by Boolean circuits with a total cost of $O(n^3).$\n",
    "\n",
    "As is typical, all of these bounds can be improved using asymptotically fast algorithms; these bounds assume we're using standard algorithms for basic arithmetic operations.\n",

    "## Factoring by order finding\n",
    "\n",
    "The very last thing we need to discuss is how solving the order-finding problem helps us to factor.\n",
    "This part is completely classical — it has nothing specifically to do with quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic idea.\n",
    "We want to factorize the number $N,$ and we can do this *recursively*.\n",
    "Specifically, we can focus on the task of *splitting* $N,$ which means finding any two integers $b,c\\geq 2$ for which $N = bc.$\n",
    "This isn't possible if $N$ is a prime number, but we can efficiently test to see if $N$ is prime using a primality testing algorithm first, and if $N$ isn't prime we'll try to split it.\n",
    "Once we split $N,$ we can simply recurse on $b$ and $c$ until all of our factors are prime and we obtain the prime factorization of $N.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting even integers is easy: we just output $2$ and $N/2.$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also easy to split perfect powers, meaning numbers of the form $N = s^j$ for integers $s,j\\geq 2,$ just by\n",
    "approximating the roots $N^{1/2},$ $N^{1/3},$ $N^{1/4},$ and so on, and checking nearby integers as suspects for $s.$\n",
    "We don't need to go further than $\\log(N)$ steps into this sequence, because at that point the root drops below $2$ and won't reveal additional candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good that we can do both of these things because order finding won't help us to factor even numbers or for *prime* powers, where the number $s$ happens to be prime.\n",
    "If $N$ is odd and not a prime power, however, order finding allows us to split $N.$\n",

    "> 4. Let $r$ be the order of $a$ modulo $N.$ (Here's where we need order finding.)\n",
    "> 5. If $r$ is even:\n",

    "\n",
    "A run of this algorithm may fail to find a factor of $N.$\n",
    "Specifically, this happens in two situations:\n",
    "- The order of $a$ modulo $N$ is odd.\n",
    "- The order of $a$ modulo $N$ is even and $\\gcd\\bigl(a^{r/2} - 1, N\\bigr) = 1.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using basic number theory it can be proved that, for a random choice of $a,$ with probability at least $1/2$ neither of these events happen.\n",
    "In fact, the probability that either event happens is at most $2^{-(m-1)}$ for $m$ being the number of distinct prime factors of $N,$\n",
    "which is why the assumption that $N$ is not a prime power is needed.\n",
    "(The assumption that $N$ is odd is also required for this fact to be true.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that each run has at least a 50% chance to split $N.$\n",
    "Therefore, if we run the algorithm $t$ times, randomly choosing $a$ each time, we'll succeed in splitting $N$ with probability at least $1 - 2^{-t}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind the algorithm is as follows.\n",
    "If we have a choice of $a$ for which the order $r$ of $a$ modulo $N$ is even, then $r/2$ is an integer and we can consider the\n",
    "numbers\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, we know that $a^r \\; (\\textrm{mod}\\; N) = 1$ by the definition of the order — which is another way of saying that $N$ evenly divides $a^r - 1.$\n",
    "That means that $N$ evenly divides the product\n",

    "\\bigl(a^{r/2} - 1\\bigr) \\bigl(a^{r/2} + 1\\bigr).\n",

    "\n",
    "For this to be true, all of the prime factors of $N$ must also be prime factors of $a^{r/2} - 1$ or $a^{r/2} + 1$ (or both) — and for a random selection of $a$ it turns out to be unlikely that all of the prime factors of $N$ will divide one of the terms and none will divide the other.\n",
    "Otherwise, so long as some of the prime factors of $N$ divide the first term and some divide the second term, we'll be able to find a non-trivial factor of $N$ by computing the GCD with the first term."
