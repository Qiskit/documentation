    "> Promise: $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $U$ \\\n",
    "> Output: an approximation to the number $\\theta\\in[0,1)$ satisfying $U\\vert\\psi\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i \\theta}\\vert\\psi\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few remarks about this problem statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The phase estimation problem is different from other problems we've seen so far in the course in that the input includes a quantum state. Typically we focus on problems having classical inputs and outputs, but nothing prevents us from considering quantum state inputs like this. In terms of its practical relevance, the phase estimation problem is typically encountered as a *subproblem* inside of a larger computation, like we'll see in the context of integer factorization later in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The statement of the phase estimation problem above isn't specific about what constitutes an approximation of $\\theta,$ but we can formulate more precise problem statements depending on our needs and interests. In the context of integer factorization, we'll demand a very precise approximation to $\\theta,$ but in other cases we might be satisfied with a very rough approximation. We'll discuss shortly how the precision we require affects the computational cost of a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Notice that as we go from $\\theta = 0$ toward $\\theta = 1$ in the phase estimation problem, we're going all the way around the unit circle, starting from $e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 0} = 1$ and moving counter-clockwise toward $e^{2\\pi i \\cdot 1} = 1.$ That is, when we reach $\\theta = 1$ we're back where we started at $\\theta = 0.$ So, as we consider the accuracy of approximations, choices of $\\theta$ near $1$ should be considered as being near $0.$ For example, an approximation $\\theta = 0.999$ should be considered as being within $1/1000$ of $\\theta = 0.$"
