# Overview

!["Hero image"](/learning/images/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/hero.svg)

Welcome to *Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithms,* the second course in the *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation* series comprising the following courses:

- [Basics of quantum information](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information)
- Fundamentals of quantum algorithms (this course)
- [General formulation of quantum information](/learning/courses/general-formulation-of-quantum-information)
- [Foundations of quantum error correction](/learning/courses/foundations-of-quantum-error-correction)

This course explores computational advantages of quantum information, including what we can do with quantum computers and their advantages over classical computers.
It begins with quantum query algorithms, which offer simple proof-of-concept demonstrations for quantum algorithms, and then moves on to quantum algorithms for problems
including integer factorization and unstructured search.

This course is intended for students, professionals, and hobbyists in fields such as computer science, physics, engineering, and mathematics who are eager to gain knowledge on the theoretical foundations of quantum information and computation.
