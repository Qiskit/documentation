    "\n",
    "First, any *deterministic* classical algorithm that correctly solves the Deutsch-Jozsa problem must make exponentially many queries:\n",
    "$2^{n-1} + 1$ queries are required in the worst case.\n",
    "The reasoning is that, if a deterministic algorithm queries $f$ on $2^{n-1}$ or fewer different strings, and obtains the same function value every time, then both answers are still possible.\n",
    "The function might be constant, or it might be balanced but through bad luck the queries all happen to return the same function value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second possibility might seem unlikely — but for deterministic algorithms there's no randomness or uncertainty, so they will fail systematically on certain functions.\n",
    "We therefore have a significant advantage of quantum over classical algorithms in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a catch, however, which is that *probabilistic* classical algorithms can solve the Deutsch-Jozsa problem with very high probability using just a few queries.\n",
    "In particular, if we simply choose a few different strings of length $n$ randomly, and query $f$ on those strings, it's unlikely that we'll get the same function value for all of them when $f$ is balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be specific, if we choose $k$ input strings $x^1,\\ldots,x^k \\in \\Sigma^n$ uniformly at random, evaluate $f(x^1),\\ldots,f(x^k),$ and answer $0$ if the function values are all the same, and $1$ if not, then we'll always be correct when $f$ is constant, and wrong in the case that $f$ is balanced with probability just $2^{-k + 1}.$\n",
    "If we take $k = 11,$ for instance, this algorithm will answer correctly with probability greater than $99.9$%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we do still have a rather modest advantage of quantum over classical algorithms — but it is nevertheless a quantifiable advantage representing an improvement over Deutsch's algorithm."

    "### Remark on nomenclature\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, it is common that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is referred to as the \"Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm.\"\n",
    "This is slightly misleading, because the algorithm *is* the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, as Bernstein and Vazirani were very clear about in their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Bernstein and Vazirani did after showing that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm solves the Bernstein-Vazirani problem (as it is stated above) was to define a much more complicated problem, known as the *recursive Fourier sampling problem*.\n",
    "This is a highly contrived problem where solutions to different instances of the problem effectively unlock new levels of the problem arranged in a tree-like structure.\n",
    "The Bernstein-Vazirani problem is essentially just the base case of this more complicated problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive Fourier sampling problem was the first known example of a query problem where quantum algorithms have a so-called *super-polynomial* advantage over probabilistic algorithms, thereby surpassing the advantage of quantum over classical offered by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, the recursive version of the problem amplifies the $1$ versus $n$ advantage of quantum algorithms to something much larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging aspect of the mathematical analysis establishing this advantage is showing that classical query algorithms can't solve the problem without making lots of queries.\n",
    "This is quite typical; for many problems it can be very difficult to rule out creative classical approaches that solve them efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon's problem, and the algorithm for it described in the next section, does provide a much simpler example of a super-polynomial (and, in fact, exponential) advantage of quantum over classical algorithms, and for this reason the recursive Fourier sampling problem is less often discussed.\n",
    "It is, nevertheless, an interesting computational problem in its own right."
