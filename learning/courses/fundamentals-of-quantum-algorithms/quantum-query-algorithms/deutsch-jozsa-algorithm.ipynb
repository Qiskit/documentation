    "Deutsch's algorithm outperforms all classical algorithms for a query problem, but the advantage is quite modest: one query versus two.\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm extends this advantage — and, in fact, it can be used to solve a couple of different query problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quantum circuit description of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.\n",

    "We'll begin with the query problem the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm was originally intended to solve, which is known as the *Deutsch-Jozsa problem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input function for this problem takes the form $f:\\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ for an arbitrary positive integer $n.$\n",
    "Like Deutsch's problem, the task is to output $0$ if $f$ is constant and $1$ if $f$ is balanced, which again means that the number of input strings on which the function takes the value $0$ is equal to the number of input strings on which the function takes the value $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, when $n$ is larger than $1,$ there are functions of the form $f:\\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma$ that are neither constant nor balanced.\n",

    "For the Deutsch-Jozsa problem, we simply don't worry about functions like this — they're considered to be \"don't care\" inputs.\n",

    "if every one of the $n$ measurement outcomes is $0,$ then the function $f$ is constant;\n",
    "and otherwise, if at least one of the measurement outcomes is $1,$ then the function $f$ is balanced.\n",
    "Another way to say this is that the circuit described above is followed by a classical post-processing step in which the OR of the measurement outcomes is computed to produce the output.\n",

    "### Classical difficulty\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm works every time, always giving us the correct answer when the promise is met, and requires a single query.\n",
    "How does this compare with classical query algorithms for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, any *deterministic* classical algorithm that correctly solves the Deutsch-Jozsa problem must make exponentially many queries:\n",
    "$2^{n-1} + 1$ queries are required in the worst case.\n",
    "The reasoning is that, if a deterministic algorithm queries $f$ on $2^{n-1}$ or fewer different strings, and obtains the same function value every time, then both answers are still possible.\n",
    "The function might be constant, or it might be balanced but through bad luck the queries all happen to return the same function value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second possibility might seem unlikely — but for deterministic algorithms there's no randomness or uncertainty, so they will fail systematically on certain functions.\n",
    "We therefore have a significant advantage of quantum over classical algorithms in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a catch, however, which is that *probabilistic* classical algorithms can solve the Deutsch-Jozsa problem with very high probability using just a few queries.\n",
    "In particular, if we simply choose a few different strings of length $n$ randomly, and query $f$ on those strings, it's unlikely that we'll get the same function value for all of them when $f$ is balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be specific, if we choose $k$ input strings $x^1,\\ldots,x^k \\in \\Sigma^n$ uniformly at random, evaluate $f(x^1),\\ldots,f(x^k),$ and answer $0$ if the function values are all the same, and $1$ if not, then we'll always be correct when $f$ is constant, and wrong in the case that $f$ is balanced with probability just $2^{-k + 1}.$\n",
    "If we take $k = 11,$ for instance, this algorithm will answer correctly with probability greater than $99.9$%.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, we do still have a rather modest advantage of quantum over classical algorithms — but it is nevertheless a quantifiable advantage representing an improvement over Deutsch's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Bernstein-Vazirani problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll discuss a problem known as the *Bernstein-Vazirani problem*.\n",
    "It's also called the *Fourier sampling problem*, although there are more general formulations of this problem that also go by that name.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's introduce some notation.\n",

    "It is, in fact, possible to solve the Bernstein-Vazirani problem classically by querying the function on each of the $n$ strings having a single $1,$ in each possible position, and $0$ for all other bits, which reveals the bits of $s$ one at a time.\n",
    "So, the advantage of quantum over classical algorithms for this problem is $1$ query versus $n$ queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remark on nomenclature\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Bernstein-Vazirani problem, it is common that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is referred to as the \"Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm.\"\n",
    "This is slightly misleading, because the algorithm *is* the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, as Bernstein and Vazirani were very clear about in their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Bernstein and Vazirani did after showing that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm solves the Bernstein-Vazirani problem (as it is stated above) was to define a much more complicated problem, known as the *recursive Fourier sampling problem*.\n",
    "This is a highly contrived problem where solutions to different instances of the problem effectively unlock new levels of the problem arranged in a tree-like structure.\n",
    "The Bernstein-Vazirani problem is essentially just the base case of this more complicated problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive Fourier sampling problem was the first known example of a query problem where quantum algorithms have a so-called *super-polynomial* advantage over probabilistic algorithms, thereby surpassing the advantage of quantum over classical offered by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, the recursive version of the problem amplifies the $1$ versus $n$ advantage of quantum algorithms to something much larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging aspect of the mathematical analysis establishing this advantage is showing that classical query algorithms can't solve the problem without making lots of queries.\n",
    "This is quite typical; for many problems it can be very difficult to rule out creative classical approaches that solve them efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon's problem, and the algorithm for it described in the next section, does provide a much simpler example of a super-polynomial (and, in fact, exponential) advantage of quantum over classical algorithms, and for this reason the recursive Fourier sampling problem is less often discussed.\n",
    "It is, nevertheless, an interesting computational problem in its own right."
