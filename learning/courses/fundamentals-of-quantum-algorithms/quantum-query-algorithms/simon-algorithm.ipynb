    "# Simon's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon's algorithm is a quantum query algorithm for a problem known as *Simon's problem*.\n",
    "This is a promise problem with a flavor similar to the Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani problems, but the specifics are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simon's algorithm is significant because it provides an *exponential* advantage of quantum over classical (including probabilistic) algorithms, and the technique it uses inspired Peter Shor's discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for integer factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simon's problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The input function for Simon's problem takes the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f:\\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma^m\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for positive integers $n$ and $m.$\n",
    "We could restrict our attention to the case $m = n$ in the interest of simplicity, but there's little to be gained in making this assumption — Simon's algorithm and its analysis are basically the same either way.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Figure title=\"Simon's problem\">\n",
    "Input: a function $f:\\Sigma^n \\rightarrow \\Sigma^m$ \\\n",
    "Promise: there exists a string $s\\in\\Sigma^n$ such that $[f(x) = f(y)] \\Leftrightarrow\n",
    "[(x = y) \\vee (x \\oplus s = y)]$ for all $x,y\\in\\Sigma^n$ \\\n",
    "Output: the string $s$\n",
    "</Figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll unpack the promise to better understand what it says momentarily, but first let's be clear that it requires that $f$ has a very special structure — so most functions won't satisfy this promise.\n",
    "It's also fitting to acknowledge that this problem isn't intended to have practical importance.\n",
    "Rather, it's a somewhat artificial problem tailor-made to be easy for quantum computers and hard for classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main cases: the first case is that $s$ is the all-zero string $0^n,$ and the second case is that $s$ is not the all-zero string.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Case 1: $s=0^n.$\n",
    "  If $s$ is the all-zero string, then we can simplify the if and only if statement in the promise so that it reads $[f(x) = f(y)] \\Leftrightarrow [x = y].$\n",
    "  This is equivalent to $f$ being a one-to-one function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Case 2: $s\\neq 0^n.$\n",
    "  If $s$ is not the all-zero string, then the promise being satisfied for this string implies that $f$ is *two-to-one*, meaning that for every possible output string of $f,$ there are exactly two input strings that cause $f$ to output that string. Moreover, these two input strings must take the form $w$ and $w \\oplus s$ for some string $w.$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to recognize that there can only be one string $s$ that works if the promise is met, so there's always a unique correct answer for functions that satisfy the promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a function taking the form $f:\\Sigma^3 \\rightarrow \\Sigma^5$ that satisfies the promise for the string $s = 011.$\n",
    "\n",

    "There are $8$ different input strings and $4$ different output strings, each of which occurs twice — so this is a two-to-one function.\n",
    "Moreover, for any two different input strings that produce the same output string, we see that the bitwise XOR of these two input strings is equal to $011,$ which is equivalent to saying that either one of them equals the other XORed with $s.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the only thing that matters about the actual output strings is whether they're the same or different for different choices of input strings.\n",
    "For instance, in the example above, there are four strings $(10011,$ $00101,$ $00001,$ and $11010)$ that appear as outputs of $f.$ We could replace these four strings with different strings, so long as they're all distinct, and the correct solution $s = 011$ would not change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm description\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quantum circuit diagram representing Simon's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Simon's algorithm](/learning/images/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/Simon.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, there are $n$ qubits on the top that are acted upon by Hadamard gates and $m$ qubits on the bottom that go directly into the query gate.\n",
    "It looks very similar to the algorithms we've already discussed in the lesson, but this time there's no phase kickback; the bottom $m$ qubits all go into the query gate in the state $\\vert 0\\rangle.$\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve Simon's problem using this circuit will actually require several independent runs of it followed by a classical post-processing step, which will be described later after the behavior of the circuit is analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of Simon's algorithm begins along similar lines to the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When the $U_f$ is performed, the output of the function $f$ is XORed onto the all-zero state of the bottom $m$ qubits, so the state becomes\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the analysis diverges from the ones for the previous algorithms in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're interested in the probability for the measurements to result in each possible string $y\\in\\Sigma^n.$\n",
    "Through the rules for analyzing measurements described in the *Multiple systems* lesson of the *Basics of quantum information* course, we find that the probability $p(y)$ to obtain the string $y$ is equal to\n",

    "To get a better handle on these probabilities, we'll need just a bit more notation and terminology.\n",

    "(This notation should not be confused with the *inverse* of the function $f,$ which may not exist.\n",
    "The fact that the argument on the left-hand side is the set $\\{z\\}$ rather than the element $z$ is the clue that allows us to avoid this confusion.)\n",

    "The question remaining is whether there will be any other vectors in the null space of $M$ besides the ones corresponding to $0^n$ and $s.$\n",

    "More generally, if we replace $k = n + 10$ with $k = n + r$ for an arbitrary choice of a positive integer $r,$ the probability that the vectors corresponding to $0^n$ and $s$ are alone in the null space of $M$ is at least $1 - 2^{-r}.$\n",

    "How many queries does a *classical* query algorithm need to solve Simon's problem?\n",
    "The answer is: a lot, in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different precise statements that can be made about the classical difficulty of this problem, and here's just one of them.\n",
    "If we have any probabilistic query algorithm, and that algorithm makes fewer than $2^{n/2 - 1} - 1$ queries, which is a number of queries that's *exponential* in $n,$ then that algorithm will fail to solve Simon's problem with probability at least $1/2.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, proving impossibility results like this can be very challenging, but this one isn't too difficult to prove through an elementary probabilistic analysis.\n",
    "Here, however, we'll only briefly examine the basic intuition behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're trying to find the hidden string $s,$ but so long as we don't query the function on two strings having the same output value, we'll get very limited information about $s.$\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, all we'll learn is that the hidden string $s$ is *not* the exclusive-OR of any two distinct strings we've queried.\n",
    "And if we query fewer than $2^{n/2 - 1} - 1$ strings, then there will still be a lot of choices for $s$ that we haven't ruled out because there aren't enough pairs of strings to do this.\n",
    "This isn't a formal proof, it's just the basic idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, Simon's algorithm provides us with a striking advantage of quantum over classical algorithms within the query model.\n",
    "In particular, Simon's algorithm solves Simon's problem with a number of queries that's *linear* in the number of input bits $n$ of our function, whereas any classical algorithm, even if it's probabilistic, needs to make a number of queries that's *exponential* in $n$ in order to solve Simon's problem with a reasonable probability of success."
