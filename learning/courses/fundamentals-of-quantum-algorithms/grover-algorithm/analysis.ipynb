    "Now we'll analyze Grover's algorithm to understand how it works.\n",
    "We'll start with what could be described as a *symbolic* analysis, where we calculate how the Grover operation $G$ acts on certain states, and then we'll tie this symbolic analysis to a *geometric* picture that's helpful for visualizing how the algorithm works.\n",

    "## Solutions and non-solutions\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The set $A_1$ contains all of the solutions to our search problem while $A_0$ contains the strings that aren't solutions (which we can refer to as *non-solutions* when it's convenient).\n",
    "These two sets satisfy $A_0 \\cap A_1 = \\varnothing$ and $A_0 \\cup A_1 = \\Sigma^n,$ which is to say that this is a *bipartition* of $\\Sigma^n.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll define two unit vectors representing uniform superpositions over the sets of solutions and non-solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  \\vert A_0\\rangle &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\vert A_0\\vert}} \\sum_{x\\in A_0} \\vert x\\rangle \\\\\n",
    "  \\vert A_1\\rangle &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\vert A_1\\vert}} \\sum_{x\\in A_1} \\vert x\\rangle\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",

    "\n",
    "Formally speaking, each of these vectors is only defined when its corresponding set is nonempty, but hereafter we're going to focus on the case that neither $A_0$ nor $A_1$ is empty.\n",
    "The cases that $A_0 = \\varnothing$ and $A_1 = \\varnothing$ are easily handled separately, and we'll do that later.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, the notation being used here is common: any time we have a finite and nonempty set $S,$ we can write $\\vert S\\rangle$ to denote the quantum state vector that's uniform over the elements of $S.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also define $\\vert u \\rangle$ to be a *uniform* quantum state over all $n$-bit strings:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have that $\\vert u\\rangle = H^{\\otimes n} \\vert 0^n \\rangle,$ so $\\vert u\\rangle$ represents the state of the register $\\mathsf{Q}$ after the initialization in step 1 of Grover's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that just before the iterations of $G$ happen in step 2, the state of $\\mathsf{Q}$ is contained in the two-dimensional vector space spanned by $\\vert A_0\\rangle$ and $\\vert A_1\\rangle,$ and moreover the coefficients of these vectors are real numbers.\n",
    "As we will see, the state of $\\mathsf{Q}$ will always have these properties — meaning that the state is a real linear combination of $\\vert A_0\\rangle$ and $\\vert A_1\\rangle$ — after any number of iterations of the operation $G$ in step 2.\n",

    "## An observation about the Grover operation\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we were to substitute the function $f$ with the function $g,$ Grover's algorithm wouldn't function any differently — because the states we obtain from the algorithm in the two cases are necessarily equivalent up to a global phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't a problem!\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, the algorithm doesn't care which strings are solutions and which are non-solutions — it only needs to be able to *distinguish* solutions and non-solutions to operate correctly.\n",

    "## Action of the Grover operation\n",
