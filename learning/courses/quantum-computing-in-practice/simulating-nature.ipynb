    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most compelling applications of quantum computers is their ability to simulate natural phenomena. In this lesson, we will explore how quantum computers are used to tackle quantum dynamics problems—specifically, how they help us understand the time-evolution of a quantum system.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will take a broad look at the general steps involved in conducting these simulations. Then, we will examine a concrete example: IBM’s 2023 experiment that showcased the concept of quantum utility. This experiment serves as an excellent case study for understanding the practical steps and implications of simulating quantum dynamics with real quantum hardware.\n",
    "By the end, you will have a clearer picture of how researchers approach these challenges and why quantum simulation holds such promise for advancing our understanding of the natural world.\n",

    "Richard Feynman gave a highly-influential lecture at Caltech in 1959. It was famously titled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” in playful allusion to the vast, unexplored possibilities at the microscopic scale. Feynman argued that much of physics at the atomic and subatomic levels had yet to be uncovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of the talk grew in the 1980s as technology progressed. During this period, Feynman revisited these ideas in another important lecture at Caltech, presenting a paper called “Simulating Nature with Computers.” There, he posed a bold question: could computers be used to perform exact simulations that replicate nature’s behavior at the quantum level? Feynman suggested that, instead of relying on rough approximations to model atomic processes, we could use computers that harness the laws of quantum mechanics themselves—not merely to model nature, but to emulate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this type of physical simulation that we will examine today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall this timeline graphic introduced in a previous episode. At one end of the spectrum, we see problems that are straightforward to solve and do not require the enhanced speed quantum computing might bring.\n",

    "\n",
    "At the opposite end are extremely challenging problems that demand fully fault-tolerant quantum machines — technology that is not yet available. Fortunately, many simulation problems are believed to fall somewhere in the middle of this timeline, within the range where today’s quantum computers can already be effectively applied. There are many reasons to be excited and intrigued by this prospect, as simulating nature forms the foundation for a wide range of promising applications.\n",

    "## General workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Before anyone can apply quantum computing to these exciting areas, it’s important to first understand the basic steps in a typical simulation workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify system Hamiltonian\n",
    "2. Hamiltonian encoding\n",
    "3. State preparation\n",
    "4. State evolution circuit\n",
    "5. Circuit optimization\n",
    "6. Circuit execution\n",
    "7. Post-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins by identifying a quantum system of interest. This helps determine the Hamiltonian that governs its time evolution, as well as a meaningful description of its initial properties, or its state. Next, you need to select an appropriate method to implement the time evolution of this state. Note that the first four steps in this workflow are all part of the *Mapping* step in the Qiskit patterns framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up the time-evolution circuit, the subsequent stages involve performing the actual experiment. This typically includes optimizing the quantum circuit that implements the time-evolution algorithm, running the circuit on quantum hardware, and post-processing the results. These are the same as the last three steps in the Qiskit patterns framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets walk through what these steps mean before we move on to coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Identify the system Hamiltonian__\n",
    "\n",
    "The first essential step in performing a simulation experiment is to identify the Hamiltonian that describes the system. In many cases, the Hamiltonian is well established. However, sometimes we need to construct it by understanding the energy contributions of smaller parts within the full system. For example, this might involve representing the Hamiltonian as a sum of terms,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H=\\sum_i^N {h_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each term $h_i$ acts on one of the $N$ local subsystems of the total Hamiltonian $H$. In the case of indistinguishable elementary particles, it is important to determine whether the system involves fermions or bosons, as this affects the system's statistics and how it must be modeled. In practice, people are often interested in physical systems in which the elements are presumed to be well-separated or labeled, and thus distinguishable, as in spins on a lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A lattice with spins and a molecule which is bonded together using electrons which are fermions.](/learning/images/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/simulating-nature/spins-fermions.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Hamiltonian encoding__\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to encode the Hamiltonian and translate it into a form that a quantum computer can process. Typically, these Hamiltonians are composed of elementary particles or distinguishable spin systems (sometimes simply called \"spin systems\" for short, though technically fermions and bosons are also systems of objects with spin). When simulating identical fermions or bosons, it is necessary to apply an encoding transformation, such as the Jordan-Wigner or Bravyi-Kitaev transformation. These methods provide a systematic way to convert the Hamiltonian, originally expressed in terms of fermionic or bosonic operators on indistinguishable particles, into Pauli operators acting on distinguishable qubits. Pauli operators are especially convenient because they can be directly translated into quantum gates on a quantum computer. For instance, the Jordan-Wigner transformation maps fermionic operators to Pauli operators in a clear and well-defined manner. On the other hand, if the system already involves distinguishable spin-1/2 particles, then the Hamiltonian is already in a suitable form for quantum computation and no additional encoding is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A flow chart showing different potential types of mappings for different system types including bosons, fermions, and distinguishable particles like spins on a lattice.](/learning/images/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/simulating-nature/ham-encoding.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. State preparation__\n",
    "\n",
    "After encoding the desired Hamiltonian into the quantum computer’s gate set, the next important step is to select an appropriate initial quantum state to begin the simulation. Ideally, this state should represent a physically meaningful configuration of the system under study. For instance, if the goal is to investigate the ground state energy of a molecule, one might start with a Hartree-Fock approximation or another easily-prepared ansatz that has significant overlap with the true ground state. The choice of initial state influences not only the convergence of variational algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) but also affects the accuracy and efficiency of time evolution and sampling. Essentially, the initial state serves as the starting point for the computation, laying the groundwork for extracting useful observables from the quantum system being modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write an arbitrary $n$-qubit state as a superposition of computational basis states $∣c_i\\rangle$ with coefficients $a_i$, satisfying normalization conditions. Preparing such a state can generally be approached by applying a specific operator $\\hat{O}$ to the initial state, which is typically the all-zero standard basis state by convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}{a_i |c_i\\rangle}=\\hat{O}|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this process often requires an exponential number of CNOT gates, making it generally resource-intensive. We often focus on preparing initial states for which implementation resource demands are more modest. For example, product states, where qubits are not entangled, can be prepared using only single-qubit operations, significantly reducing complexity."

When only the expectation values of the relevant observables are needed, these can be directly obtained from the Estimator primitive, available both as raw results and with error mitigation applied. Often, these measured expectation values serve as the starting point for additional calculations involving other quantities of interest. Such additional calculations typically do not require quantum computation and can be efficiently performed on a classical computer."

However, unlike PEC, it avoids the exponential sampling overhead that typically grows with circuit noise. This efficiency makes PEA a practical and robust approach for noise amplification in ZNE, facilitating more reliable quantum error mitigation"

    "To characterize the noise model, we first need to identify the distinct layers of two-qubit operations within the circuit. For each of these layers, we apply a Pauli twirling procedure to the two-qubit gates, which helps ensure that the noise can be accurately described by a damping noise model. Next, we repeat pairs of identity layers at various depths, and finally, we fit the fidelity values to determine the error rates for each noise channel.\n",

    "Once the experiment is finished, you are ready to view your result by [post-processing](/docs/tutorials/probabilistic-error-amplification#step-4-post-process-and-return-result-in-desired-classical-format) it. The dotted gray line in the plotted data represents the results obtained using approximate classical methods, with the approximation error reduced to a low threshold. The raw data points for the various noise factors, selected at the outset, are clearly offset from this dotted line. In contrast, the solid blue line displays the data after applying our Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) processing, which noticeably brings the results much closer to the exact values.\n",
    "In summary, the values obtained under normal noise conditions (noise factor nf=1.0nf=1.0) show significant deviation from the exact results. Meanwhile, the mitigated values align closely with the exact ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Phase Estimation Algorithm (PEA)-based noise mitigation technique.\n",

    "To quickly summarize what we have learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantum simulation is one of the most promising application areas in the short  to mid term.\n",
    "* It has wide-ranging applications, from pharmaceuticals to high-energy physics, materials science, and more.\n",
    "* The Utility paper from IBM, published in 2023 pointed the way towards being able to use quantum computers for scientific discovery  and we worked through the associated tutorial that goes along with that paper.\n",
    "* The steps to work through a simulation problem from start to finish are relatively straightforward, especially once you get the hang of it, and we hope that you can now use this video + tutorial as a guide for even more simulation problems."
