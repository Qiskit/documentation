    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most compelling applications of quantum computers is their ability to simulate natural phenomena. In this lesson, we will explore how quantum computers are used to solve quantum dynamics problems—specifically, how they help us understand the time-evolution of a quantum system.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will take a broad look at the general steps involved in conducting these simulations. Then, we will examine a concrete example: the experiment that IBM presented in 2023, which   showcased the concept of quantum utility. This experiment serves as an excellent case study for understanding the practical steps and implications of simulating quantum dynamics with real quantum hardware.\n",
    "By the end, you will have a clearer picture of how researchers approach these challenges and why quantum simulation holds such promise for advancing our understanding of the natural world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Richard Feynman gave a highly influential lecture at Caltech in 1959. It was famously titled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom,” in playful allusion to the vast, unexplored possibilities at the microscopic scale. Feynman argued that much of physics at the atomic and subatomic levels had yet to be uncovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance of the talk grew in the 1980s as technology progressed. During this period, Feynman revisited these ideas in another important lecture at Caltech, presenting a paper called “Simulating Nature with Computers.” There, he posed a bold question: could computers be used to perform exact simulations that replicate nature’s behavior at the quantum level? Feynman suggested that, instead of relying on rough approximations to model atomic processes, we could use computers that harness the laws of quantum mechanics themselves—not merely to model nature, but to emulate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this type of physical simulation that we will examine through this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall this timeline graphic introduced in a previous episode. At one end of the spectrum, we see problems that are straightforward to solve and do not require the enhanced speed quantum computing might bring.\n",

    "\n",
    "At the opposite end are extremely challenging problems that demand fully fault-tolerant quantum machines — technology that is not yet available. Fortunately, many simulation problems are believed to fall somewhere in the middle of this timeline, within the range where today’s quantum computers can already be effectively applied. There are many reasons to be excited and intrigued by this prospect, as simulating nature forms the foundation for a wide range of promising applications.\n",

    "## General workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Before anyone can apply quantum computing to these exciting areas, it's important to first understand the basic steps in a typical simulation workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify system Hamiltonian\n",
    "2. Hamiltonian encoding\n",
    "3. State preparation\n",
    "4. Time-evolution of the state\n",
    "5. Circuit optimization\n",
    "6. Circuit execution\n",
    "7. Post-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins by identifying a quantum system of interest. This helps determine the Hamiltonian that governs its time evolution, as well as a meaningful description of its initial properties, or its state. Next, you need to select an appropriate method to implement the time evolution of this state. Note that the first four steps in this workflow are all part of the *Mapping* step in the Qiskit patterns framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up the time-evolution circuit, the subsequent stages involve performing the actual experiment. This typically includes optimizing the quantum circuit that implements the time-evolution algorithm, running the circuit on quantum hardware, and post-processing the results. These are the same as the last three steps in the Qiskit patterns framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll discuss what these steps mean before we move on to coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Identify the system Hamiltonian__\n",
    "\n",
    "The first essential step in performing a simulation experiment is to identify the Hamiltonian that describes the system. In many cases, the Hamiltonian is well established. However, we often construct it by summing up the energy contributions from smaller parts of the system. This is typically expressed as a sum of terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H=\\sum_i^N {H_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where each term $H_i$ acts on one of the $N$ local subsystems (like a single particle or a small group of particles) of the total Hamiltonian $H$. In the case of indistinguishable elementary particles, it is important to determine whether the system involves fermions or bosons, where fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, meaning no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum states like electrons. Unlike fermions, multiple bosons can exist in the same quantum state, and these difference affects the system's statistics and how it must be modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, people are often interested in physical systems in which the elements are presumed to be well-separated or labeled, and thus distinguishable, as in spins on a lattice.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A lattice with spins and a molecule which is bonded together using electrons which are fermions.](/learning/images/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/simulating-nature/spins-fermions.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This system consists of magnetic dipole spins arranged on a lattice, which are treated as distinguishable particles by counting their address. This system is described by the Transverse-Field Ising Model, and its Hamiltonian is constructed from the sum of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = \\sum_i^N {H_i} = J \\sum_{<i,j>}Z_iZ_j + h\\sum_{i=0}^N X_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the first term represents the interaction energy between neighboring spins. Here the $<i,j>$ indicates that we sum over all pairs of spins that are directly connected on the lattice, $Z_i$ and $Z_j$ are the Pauli-Z matrices, which represent the state of the spins at the site $i$ and $j$, and $J$ is the coupling constant, which defines the strength of this interaction. The second term represents the influence of an external magnetic field applied across the entire system. Here $X_i$ is the Pauli-X matrix acting on the individual spin at site $i$, and $h$ indicates the strength of this external field.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Hamiltonian encoding__\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to **translate** the Hamiltonian into a form that a quantum computer can process, which we call encoding. This encoding process depends critically on the type of particles in systems: distinguishable or indistinguishable, and fermion or boson, if the particles are indistinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A flow chart showing different potential types of mappings for different system types including bosons, fermions, and distinguishable particles like spins on a lattice.](/learning/images/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/simulating-nature/ham-encoding.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a system with distinguishable particles, like $1/2$ spins fixed on a lattice, which we took a simple look at above, the Hamiltonian is often already written in a language compatible with qubits. The Pauli-Z operator, for instance, naturally describes a spin's up or down, and no special encoding is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "When simulating indistinguishable particles of fermions or bosons, it is necessary to apply an encoding transformation. These particles are used to describe within a special mathematical framework called `second quantization`, which tracks the occupation number of each quantum state by introducing `creation` and `annihilation` operators, where the creation operator $\\hat{a}_i^\\dagger$ adds one particle to state $i$ while the annihilation operator $\\hat{a}_i$ removes one particle from state $i$. Based on this second quantization framework, the fermion can be transformed by Bravyi-Kitaev and Jordan-Wigner. Jordan-Wigner transformation defines the fermionic creation operator\n",
    "$\\hat{f}_j^\\dagger = \\Bigl( \\prod\\limits_{k \\lt j}{(-Z_k)} \\Bigr)\\Bigl( \\frac{X_j + i Y_j}{2} \\Bigr)$ which fill the $j$-th quantum state with a fermion and fermionic annihilation operator $\\hat{f}_j= \\Bigl( \\prod\\limits_{k \\lt j}{(-Z_k)} \\Bigr)\\Bigl( \\frac{X_j - i Y_j}{2} \\Bigr)$ which empties a fermion from the $j$=th states. You can find more details of this Jordan-Wigner transformation at our [Quantum Computing in Practice, episode 5 - Mapping](/learning/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/mapping). Similarly, bosons also require their own encoding methods, such as the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, to be represented by qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, whether the path is direct or requires a translation, the goal is the same: to express the system's Hamiltonian in the form of Pauli spin operators that a quantum computer can understand and execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. State preparation__\n",
    "\n",
    "After encoding the desired Hamiltonian into the quantum computer's gate set, the next important step is to select an appropriate initial quantum state to begin the simulation. The choice of initial state influences not only the convergence of variational algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) but also affects the accuracy and efficiency of time evolution and sampling. Essentially, the initial state serves as the starting point for the computation, laying the groundwork for extracting useful observables from the quantum system being modeled. Ideally, this state should represent a physically meaningful configuration of the system under study.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many quantum chemistry simulations, the Hartree-Fock state can be a good starting point. In the language of second quantization, Hartree-Fock state ($|\\phi\\rangle_{HF}$) is created by applying creation operators ($\\hat{a}_i^\\dagger$) for each of the lowest-energy orbitals to the vacuum state($|vac\\rangle = |0_1 ... 0_k ... 0_N\\rangle = |0\\rangle ^{\\otimes N}$), a state with no electrons.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\phi\\rangle_{HF} = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^k \\hat{a}_i^\\dagger |0\\rangle ^{\\otimes N} = \\hat{a}_1^\\dagger ... \\hat{a}_k^\\dagger |0_1 ... 0_k ... 0_N\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, an easily prepared ansatz with significant overlap to the true ground state can serve as a good initial state for chemistry problems, such as finding the ground state energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, we can write an arbitrary $n$-qubit state as a superposition of computational basis states $∣c_i\\rangle$ with coefficients $a_i$, satisfying normalization conditions. Preparing such a state can generally be approached by applying a specific operator $\\hat{O}$ to the initial state, which is typically the all-zero standard basis state by convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}{a_i |c_i\\rangle}=\\hat{O}|0\\rangle^{\\otimes n}\\\\\n",
    "\\text{with} \\qquad \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1}{|a_i^2|}=1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this process often requires an exponential number of CNOT gates, making it generally resource intensive. We often focus on preparing initial states for which the implementation resource demands are more modest. For this reason, we often focus on preparing initial states that are less complex. A common and practical choice is a product state, where qubits are not entangled, can be prepared using only single-qubit operations, significantly reducing the resource demands of the state preparation and the complexity."

    "Now that the initial state is set, we can finally begin the simulation itself - examine how the system's state $|\\phi(t=0)\\rangle$ changed into $|\\phi(t)\\rangle$ after some time, $t$. In quantum mechanics, this evolution is described by a single mathematical operation called the time-evolution operator:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have generated our circuit, [the next step](/docs/tutorials/probabilistic-error-amplification#step-2-optimize-problem-for-quantum-hardware-execution) is to optimize it. The first part of this process involves defining a pass manager. In the context of the Qiskit SDK, transpilation is the process of transforming an input circuit into a form that is suitable for execution on a quantum device. This transformation happens through a sequence of steps known as transpiler passes.\n",
    "A pass manager is an object that holds a list of these transpiler passes and can apply them to a circuit. To create one, you initialize a `PassManager` with the desired list of transpiler passes. Ultimately, the pass manager produces an ISA circuit—a circuit expressed in terms of the backend’s Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). This means the circuit is represented using gates that are native to the backend hardware, although it does not yet include the timing information required to run the circuit on the device.\n",

    "### Qiskit patterns step 3: Execute using primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it is time to [run our circuit](/docs/tutorials/probabilistic-error-amplification#step-3-execute-using-qiskit-primitives). We will use the Estimator as our primary tool for this experiment because our goal is to measure the total magnetization of the system. The Estimator is specifically designed to estimate the expectation values of observables, making it the ideal choice here.\n",
    "At this stage, it is also essential to configure our error mitigation settings. We will apply Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) to improve the accuracy of our results. In the tutorial, you will see that we specify two or more noise factor values at which to evaluate the extrapolated models, and we select “Probabilistic Error Amplification” (PEA) as our amplification method. PEA is preferred for this experiment because it scales significantly better than other options, which is crucial when working with systems of 100 or more qubits.\n",

    "Before we proceed to post-processing, let’s take a brief moment to clarify what is meant by Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). We have touched on this concept in earlier episodes, but it’s worth reviewing briefly. ZNE is an error mitigation technique designed to reduce the impact of unknown noise that occurs during the execution of quantum circuits, provided that this noise can be scaled in a controlled way. The method relies on the assumption that expectation values scale with noise according to a known function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle A(\\lambda)\\rangle = \\langle A(0)\\rangle + \\sum_{k=0}^m {a_k \\lambda^k}+R,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $λ$ represents the noise strength, which can be intentionally amplified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of implementing ZNE consists of the following steps:\n",
    "1.\tAmplify the circuit noise for various noise factors $λ_1$, $λ_2$, … .\n",
    "2.\tExecute each noise-amplified circuit to measure the corresponding expectation values $\\langle A(\\lambda_1)\\rangle$, $\\langle A(\\lambda_2)\\rangle$, ….\n",
    "3.\tExtrapolate these results back to the zero-noise limit \\langle $A(\\lambda_0)\\rangle$.\n",

    "\n",
    "This technique allows us to estimate what the outcome would be if there were no noise, improving the accuracy of quantum computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary challenge in effectively implementing ZNE is developing an accurate noise model for the expectation value and amplifying the noise in a controlled and well-understood manner. Common techniques for error amplification in ZNE include scaling pulse duration through calibration, repeating gates using identity cycles, and adding noise via sampling Pauli channels—a method known as Probabilistic Error Amplification (PEA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these, PEA is often the preferred choice for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pulse stretching incurs a high computational cost.\n",
    "* Gate folding, which uses identity insertions, lacks strong theoretical guarantees for preserving the noise bias.\n",
    "* PEA is applicable to any circuit executed with a native noise factor, although it requires learning the noise model in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Three methods of amplifying noise for ZNE are shown: pulse stretching, gate folding, and probabilistic error amplification.](/learning/images/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/simulating-nature/noise-amp.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "PEA operates under the assumption of a layer-based noise model similar to that used in probabilistic error cancellation (PEC). However, unlike PEC, it avoids the exponential sampling overhead that typically grows with circuit noise. This efficiency makes PEA a practical and robust approach for noise amplification in ZNE, facilitating more reliable quantum error mitigation"

    "To characterize the noise model, we first need to identify the distinct layers of two-qubit operations within the circuit. For each of these layers, we apply a Pauli twirling procedure to the two-qubit gates, which helps ensure that the noise can be accurately described by a damping noise model. Next, we repeat pairs of identity layers at various depths, and finally, we fit the fidelity values to determine the error rates for each noise channel.\n",

The dotted gray line in the plotted data represents the results obtained using approximate classical methods, with the approximation error reduced to a low threshold. The raw data points for the various noise factors, selected at the outset, are clearly offset from this dotted line. In contrast, the solid blue line displays the data after applying our ZNE processing, which noticeably brings the results much closer to the exact values.\n",
