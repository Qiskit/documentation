    "# Data encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction and notation\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a quantum algorithm, classical data must somehow be brought into a quantum circuit. This is usually referred to as data *encoding*, but is also called data *loading*. Recall from previous lessons the notion of a feature mapping, a mapping of data features from one space to another. Just transferring classical data to a quantum computer is a sort of mapping, and could be called a feature mapping. In practice, the built-in feature mappings in Qiskit (like ZFeatureMap and ZZFeatureMap) will typically include rotation layers and entangling layers that extend the state to many dimensions in the Hilbert space. This encoding process is a critical part of quantum machine learning algorithms and directly affects their computational capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the encoding techniques below can be efficiently classically simulated; this is particularly easy to see in encoding methods that yield product states (i.e. which do not entangle qubits). And remember that quantum utility is most likely to lie where the quantum-like complexity of the dataset is well-matched by the encoding method. So it is very likely that you will end up writing your own encoding circuits. Here, we show a wide variety of possible encoding strategies simply so that you can compare and contrast them, and see what is possible. There are some very general statements that can be made about the usefulness of encoding techniques. For example, EfficientSU2 (see below) with a full entangling scheme is much more likely to capture quantum features of data than methods that yield product states  (like ZFeatureMap). But this does not mean EfficientSU2 is sufficient, or sufficiently well-matched to your dataset, to yield a quantum speed-up. That requires careful consideration of the structure of the data being modeled or classified. There is also a balancing act with circuit depth, since many feature maps which fully entangle the qubits in a circuit yield very deep circuits, too deep to get usable results on today's quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset is a set of $M$ data vectors: $\\text{X} = \\{\\vec{x}^{(j)}\\,|\\,j\\in [M]\\}$, where each vector is $N$ dimensional, i.e. $\\vec{x}^{(j)}=(\\vec{x}^{(j)}_1,\\ldots,\\vec{x}^{(j)}_N)\\in\\mathbb{R}^N$. This could be extended to complex data features. In his lesson, we may occassionally use these notations for the full set $(\\text{X}),$ and its specific elements like $\\vec{x}^{(j)}$. But we will mostly refer to the loading of a single vector from our dataset at a time, and will often simply refer to a single vector of $N$ features as $\\vec{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it is common to use the symbol $\\Phi(\\vec{x})$ to refer to the feature mapping $\\Phi$ of data vector $\\vec{x}$. However, it is also common to refer to mappings in quantum computing using $U(\\vec{x}),$ a notation that reinforces the unitary nature of these operations. One could correctly use the same symbol for both; both are feature mappings. Throughout this course, we tend to use $\\Phi(\\vec{x})$ when discussing feature mappings in machine learning, generally, and $U(\\vec{x})$ when discussing circuit implementations of feature mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalization and information loss\n",
    "\n",
    "In classical machine learning, training data features are often \"normalized\" or rescaled which often improves model performance. One common way of doing this is by using min-max normalization or standardization. In min-max normalization, feature columns of the data matrix $\\text{X}$ (say, feature $k$) are normalized:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^{'(i)}_k = \\frac{x^{(i)}_k - \\text{min}\\{x^{(j)}_k\\,|\\,\\vec{x}^{(j)}\\in [\\text{X}]\\}}{\\text{max}\\{x^{(j)}_k\\,|\\,\\vec{x}^{(j)}\\in [\\text{X}]\\}-\\text{min}\\{x^{(j)}_k\\,|\\,\\vec{x}^{(j)}\\in [\\text{X}]\\}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where min and max refer to the minimum and maximum of feature $k$ over the $M$ data vectors in the dataset $\\text{X}$. All the feature values then fall in the unit interval: $x^{'(i)}_k \\in [0,1]$ for all $i\\in [M]$, $k\\in[N]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalization is also a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics and quantum computing, but it is slightly different from min-max normalization. Normalization in quantum mechanics requires that the length (in the context of quantum computing, the 2-norm) of a state vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ is equal to unity: $\\|\\psi\\|=\\sqrt{\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle} = 1$, ensuring that measurement probabilities sum to 1. The state is normalized by dividing by the 2-norm; that is, by rescaling\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi\\rangle\\rightarrow\\|\\psi\\|^{-1}|\\psi\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In quantum computing and quantum mechanics, this is not a normalization imposed by people on the data, but a fundamental property of quantum states. Depending on your encoding scheme, this constraint may affect how your data are rescaled. For example, in amplitude encoding (see below), the data vector is normalized $\\vert\\vec{x}^{(j)}\\vert = 1$ as is required by quantum mechanics, and this affects the scaling of the data being encoded. In phase encoding, feature values are recommended to be rescaled as $\\vec{x}^{(j)}_i \\in (0,2\\pi]$ so that there is no information loss due to the modulo-$2\\pi$ effect of encoding to a qubit phase angle[\\[1,2\\]](#references)."

More generally, for a $P$-bit string: $\\vec{x}^{(j)}_k = (b_1, b_2, ... , b_P)$, the corresponding $P$-qubit state is $|x^{(j)}_k\\rangle = | b_1, b_2, ... , b_P \\rangle$ with $b_n \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for $n = 1 , \\dots , P$.

    "A benefit of amplitude encoding is that only $\\log_2(N)$ qubits are required for an $N$-dimensional ($N$-feature) data vector $\\vec{x}\\rightarrow|\\vec{x}\\rangle$. However, amplitude encoding is generally an inefficient procedure that requires arbitrary state preparation, which is exponential in the number of CNOT gates. Stated differently, the state preparation has a polynomial runtime complexity of $\\mathcal O(N)$ in the number of dimensions, where $N = 2^n$, and $n$ is the number of qubits. Amplitude encoding ‚Äúprovides an exponential saving in space at the cost of an exponential increase in time‚Äù[\\[3\\]](#references); however, runtime increases to $\\mathcal O(\\log N)$ are achievable in certain cases[\\[4\\]](#references).

    "### Angle encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Angle encoding is of interest in many QML models using Pauli feature maps such as quantum support vector machines (QSVMs) and variational quantum circuits (VQCs), among others. Angle encoding is closely related to phase encoding and dense angle encoding which are presented below. Here we will use \"angle encoding\" to refer to a rotation in $\\theta$, that is, a rotation away from the $z$ axis accomplished for example by an $R_X$ gate or an $R_Y$ gate[\\[1,3\\]](#references). Really, one can encode data in *any* rotation or combination of rotations. But $R_Y$ is common in the literature, so we emphasize it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "When applied to a single qubit, angle encoding imparts a Y-axis rotation proportional to the data value. Consider the encoding of a single ($k^\\text{th}$)feature from the $j^\\text{th}$ data vector in a dataset, $\\vec{x}^{(j)}_k$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\vec{x}^{(j)}_k\\rangle = R_Y(\\theta=\\vec{x}^{(j)}_k)|0\\rangle = \\textstyle\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{x}^{(j)}_k}{2}\\right)|0\\rangle + \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\vec{x}^{(j)}_k}{2}\\right)|1\\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, angle encoding can be performed using $R_X(\\theta)$ gates, although the encoded state would have a complex relative phase compared to $R_Y(\\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Angle encoding is different from the previous two methods discussed in several ways. In angle encoding:\n",
    "- Each feature value is mapped to a corresponding qubit, $\\vec{x}^{(j)}_k \\rightarrow Q_k$, leaving the qubits in a product state.\n",
    "- One numerical value is encoded at a time, rather than a whole set of features from a data point.\n",
    "- $n$ qubits are required for $N$ data features, where $n\\leq N$. Often equality holds, here. We'll see how $n<N$ is possible in the next few sections.\n",
    "- The resulting circuit is a constant depth (typically the depth is 1 prior to transpilation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant depth quantum circuit makes it particularly amenable to current quantum hardware. One additional feature of encoding our data using $\\theta$ (and specifically, our choice to use Y-axis angle encoding) is that it creates real-valued quantum states that can be useful for certain applications. For Y-axis rotation, data is mapped with a Y-axis rotation gate $R_Y(\\theta)$ by a real-valued angle $\\theta \\in (0, 2\\pi]$ ([Qiskit RYGate](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RYGate)). As with phase encoding (see below), we recommend that you rescale data so that $\\vec{x}^{(j)}_k \\in (0,2\\pi]$, preventing information loss and other unwanted effects.\n",

This is different from basis encoding and amplitude encoding, in that those methods make use of entangled states. There is not a 1:1 correspondence between data feature and qubit. In amplitude encoding, for example, you might have one feature as the amplitude of the state $|01\\rangle$ and another feature as the amplitude for $|10\\rangle$. Generally, methods that encode in product states yield shallower circuits and can store 1 or 2 features on each qubit. Methods that use entanglement and associate a feature with a state rather than a qubit result in deeper circuits, and can store more features per qubit on average.\n",

    "## Hardware-efficient feature mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "A hardware-efficient feature mapping is one that takes into account constraints of real quantum computers, in the interest of reducing noise and errors in the computation. When running quantum circuits on near-term quantum computers, there are many strategies to mitigate noise inherent to the hardware. One main strategy for hardware efficiency is the minimization of the depth of the quantum circuit so that noise and decoherence have less time to corrupt the computation. The depth of a quantum circuit is the number of time-aligned gate steps required to complete the entire computation (after circuit optimization)[\\[5\\]](#references). Recall that the depth of the abstract, logical circuit may be much lower than the depth once the circuit is transpiled for a real quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transpilation is the process of converting the quantum circuit from a high-level abstraction to one that is ready to run on a real quantum computer, taking into account constraints of the hardware. A quantum computer has a native set of single- and two-qubit gates. This means all gates in Qiskit code have to be transpiled into the set of native hardware gates. For example, in ibm_torino, a system sporting a heron r1 processor and completed in 2023, the native or basis gates are `{CZ, ID, RZ, SX, X}`. These are the two-qubit controlled-Z gate, and single-qubit gates called identity, $Z$-rotation, square root of NOT, and NOT, respectively, providing a universal set. When implementing multi-qubit gates as an equivalent subcircuit, physical two-qubit $CZ$ gates are required, along with other single-qubit gates available in hardware. In addition, to perform a two-qubit gate on a pair of qubits that are not physically coupled, SWAP gates are added to move qubit states between qubits to enable coupling, which leads to an unavoidable extension of the circuit. Using the ```optimization``` argument that can be set from 0 up to a highest level of 3. For greater control and customizability, the transpiler pipeline can be managed with the [Qiskit Pass Manager](/docs/api/qiskit/qiskit.transpiler.PassManager). Refer to the [Qiskit Transpiler documentation](/docs/api/qiskit/transpiler) for more information on transpilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Havlicek et al. 2019 [\\[2\\]](#references), one way the authors achieve hardware efficiency is by using the $ZZ$ feature map because it is a second-order expansion (see the ‚Äú$ZZ$ feature map‚Äù section above). An $N$-order expansion has $N$-qubit gates. IBM Quantum systems do not have native $N$-qubit gates, where $N>2$, so to implement them would require decomposition into two-qubit CNOT gates available in hardware. A second way the authors minimize depth is by choosing a $ZZ$ coupling topology that maps directly to the architecture couplings. A further optimization they undertake is targeting a higher-performing, suitably connected hardware subcircuit. Additional things to consider are minimizing the number of feature map repetitions and choosing a customized low-depth or ‚Äúlinear‚Äù entangling scheme instead of the ‚Äúfull‚Äù scheme that entangles all qubits.\n",

    "The above graphic shows a network of nodes and edges that represent physical qubits and hardware couplings, respectively. The coupling map and performance of ibm_torino is shown with all possible two-qubit CZ coupling gates. Qubits are color-coded on a scale based on the T1 relaxation time in microseconds (Œºs), where longer T1 times are better and in a lighter shade. The coupling edges are color-coded by CZ error, where darker shades are better. Information on the hardware specification can be accessed in the hardware backend configuration schema ```IBMQBackend.configuration()```."
