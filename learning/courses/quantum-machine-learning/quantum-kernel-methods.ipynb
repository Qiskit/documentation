    "## Introduction to quantum kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Quantum kernel method\" refers to any method that uses quantum computers to estimate a kernel. In this context, \"kernel\" will refer to the kernel matrix or individual entries therein. Recall that a feature mapping $\\Phi(\\vec{x})$ is a mapping from $\\vec{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\\Phi(\\vec{x})\\in \\mathbb{R}^{d'},$ where usually $d'>d$ and where the goal of this mapping is to make the categories of data separable by a hyperplane. The kernel function takes vectors in the feature-mapped space as arguments and returns their inner product, i.e. $K:\\mathbb{R}^d\\times\\mathbb{R}^d\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with $K(x,y) = \\langle \\Phi(x)|\\Phi(y)\\rangle$. Classically, we are interested in feature maps for which the kernel function is easy to evaluate. This often means finding a kernel function for which the inner product in the feature-mapped space can be written in terms of the original data vectors, without having to ever construct $\\Phi(x)$ and $\\Phi(y)$. In the method of quantum kernels, the feature mapping is done by a quantum circuit, and the kernel is estimated using measurements on that circuit and the relative measurement probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will examine the depths of pre-coded encoding circuits that use substantial entanglement and compare those to depths of circuits we code by hand. This is not to advocate for one method over another. You may find that pre-coded circuits are too deep, and that the entanglement in the custom-built circuit is insufficient to be useful. Again, these are shown only to enable your exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before walking through a kernel matrix estimation in detail, let us outline the workflow using the language of Qiskit patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Map classical inputs to a quantum problem\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Input: Training dataset\n",
    "*   Output: Abstract circuit for calculating a kernel matrix entry\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the dataset, the starting point is to encode the data into a quantum circuit. In other words, we need to map our data into the Hilbert space of states of our quantum computer. We do this by constructing a data-dependent circuit. There are many ways of doing this, and the previous lesson outlined a number of options. You can construct your own circuit to encode your data, or you can use a pre-made feature map like ZZFeatureMap. In this lesson, we wil do both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in order to calculate a single kernel matrix element, we will want to encode two different points, so we can estimate their inner product. A full quantum kernel workflow will of course, involve many such inner products between mapped data vectors, as well as classical machine learning methods. But the core step being iterated is the estimation of a single kernel matrix element. For this we select a data-dependent quantum circuit and map two data vectors into the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Classical_Review_background_kernel_circuit](/learning/images/courses/quantum-machine-learning/quantum-kernel-methods/classical-review-background-kernel-circuit.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the task of generating a kernel matrix, we are particularly interested in the probability of measuring the $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}$ state, in which all $N$ qubits are in the $|0\\rangle$ state. To see this, consider that the circuit responsible for encoding and mapping of one data vector $\\vec{x}_i$ can be written as $\\Phi(\\vec{x}_i)$, and the one responsible for encoding and mapping $\\vec{x}_j$ is $\\Phi(\\vec{x}_j)$, and denote the mapped states\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi(\\vec{x}_i)\\rangle = \\Phi(\\vec{x}_i)|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\psi(\\vec{x}_j)\\rangle = \\Phi(\\vec{x}_j)|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These states _are_ the mapping of the data to higher dimensions, so our desired kernel entry is the inner product\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle\\psi(\\vec{x}_j)|\\psi(\\vec{x}_i)\\rangle = \\langle 0 |^{\\otimes N}\\Phi^\\dagger(\\vec{x}_j)\\Phi(\\vec{x}_i)|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "If we operate on the default initial state $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}$ with both circuits $\\Phi^\\dagger(\\vec{x}_j)$ and $\\Phi(\\vec{x}_i)$, the probability of then measuring the state $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}$ is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_0 = |\\langle0|^{\\otimes N}\\Phi^\\dagger(\\vec{x}_j)\\Phi(\\vec{x}_i)|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}|^2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is exactly the value we want (up to $||^2$). The measurement layer of our circuit will return measurement probabilities (or so-called \"quasi-probabilities\", if certain error mitigation methods are used). The probability of interest is that of the zero state, $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Optimize problem for quantum execution\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Input: Abstract circuit, not optimized for a particular backend\n",
    "*   Output: Target circuit and observable, optimized for the selected QPU\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will use the `generate_preset_pass_manager` function from Qiskit to specify an optimization routine for our circuit with respect to the real quantum computer on which we plan to run the experiment. We set `optimization_level=3` , which means we will use the preset pass manager which provides the highest level of optimization. In this context, \"optimization\" refers to optimizing the implementation of the circuit on a real quantum computer. This includes considerations like selecting physical qubits to correspond to qubits in the abstract quantum circuit that will minimize gate depth, or selecting physical qubits with the lowest available error rates. This is not directly related to optimization of the machine learning problem (as in classical optimizers like COBYLA).\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on how you implement step 2, you may have to optimize the circuit more than once, since each pair of points involved in a matrix element produce a different circuit to be measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Execute using Qiskit Runtime Primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Input: Target circuit\n",
    "*   Output: Probability distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `Sampler` primitive from Qiskit Runtime to reconstruct a probability distribution of states yielded from sampling the circuit. Note that you may see this referred to as a \"quasi-probability distribution\", a term which is applicable where noise is an issue and when extra steps are introduced, such as in error mitigation. In such cases, the sum of all probabilities may not exactly equal 1; hence \"quasi-probability\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we optimized the circuit for the backend in Step 2, we can avoid doing transpilation on the Runtime server by setting `skip_transpilation=True` and passing the optimized circuit to the `Sampler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Post-process, return result in classical format\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Input: Probability distribution\n",
    "*   Output: A single kernel matrix element, or a kernel matrix if repeating\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the probability of measuring $|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N}$ on the quantum circuit, and populate the kernel matrix in the position corresponding to the two data vectors used. To fill out the entire kernel matrix, we need to run a quantum experiment for each entry. Once we have a kernel matrix, we can use it in many classical machine learning algorithms that accept `pre-calculated kernels`. For example: `qml_svc = SVC(kernel=\"precomputed\")`. We can then use classical workstreams to apply our model on our testing data, and get an accuracy score. Depending on our satisfaction with our accuracy score, we may need to revisit aspects of our calculation, such as our feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson outline\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will carry out these steps several ways to make optimal use of your time on real quantum computers. We will apply a quantum kernel method to\n",
    "* A single kernel matrix entry for data with relatively few features, using a real backend, so that we can easily follow what is happening at each step.\n",
    "* An entire data set with relatively few features, using a simulated backend, so that we can see how the quantum workstream connects with classical machine learning methods\n",
    "* A single kernel matrix entry for data with many features, using a real quantum computer. We will not estimate an entire kernel matrix for a large dataset, in order to respect time on IBM quantum computers."

In order to know which is true, we must apply our feature map to the entire set of data and see if the resulting kernel matrix can be manipulated to effectively separate classes with high accuracy.\n",

    "It is worth noting that we used the ```ZFeatureMap``` which resulted in low two-qubit transpiled depth (depth 1, in fact). If your circuits become too deep, it is sure to result in a lot of noise, and this will make the probability of measuring the zero state very low, even if your feature map is well-matched to your data. For example, a repetition of the above process using ```ZZFeatureMap``` and ```, entanglement='linear', reps=1``` yielded ```dist.get(0,0.0) = 0.0015``` using the same data points. This is due to the much greater circuit depths and two-qubit depths from ```ZZFeatureMap```. The figure below shows the probability distribution for that calculation.\n",

Generally, a two-qubit, transpiled depth of 10 or fewer should be no problem. A two-qubit, transpiled depth of 50-60 is state-of-the-art and will require advanced error mitigation among other tools. In between, your results may vary with data similarity, feature map expressivity, circuit width, and other factors."

    "This process for the single kernel matrix element could be repeated between other data pairs in your set to obtain the full kernel matrix. The dimension of the kernel matrix is dictated by the number of points in your training data, not the number of features. So the computing cost of manipulating the kernel matrix into a predictive model does not scale like the number of features or qubits. Even for relatively small datasets with large numbers of features, the data would still need to be matched to a feature map that yields effective classification.\n",

    "The kernel method requires that we measure the $|0\\rangle$ as accurately as possible. But gate errors and readout errors mean that there is some non-zero probability $p$ that any given qubit will be erroneously measured to be in the $|1\\rangle$ state. Even with the oversimplification that the probability of $|0\\rangle$ should be $100\\%$, for many features encoded on, say, $N$ bits, the probability of correctly measuring all bits to be $|0\\rangle$ is reduced to $(1-p)^N$. As $N$ becomes large, this method becomes less and less reliable. Overcoming this difficulty and scaling kernel estimation to more and more features is an area of current research. To learn more about this issue, see this work by [Thanasilp, Wang, Cerezo, and Holmes.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49287-w) We recommend you explore what can be done with current quantum computers, and also look forward to what will be possible in the era of error correction."
