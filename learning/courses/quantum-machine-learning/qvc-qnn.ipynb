    "# Quantum Variational Circuits & Quantum Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we implement several variational quantum circuits for a data classification task, so-called variational quantum classifiers (VQCs). At one point, it was common to refer to a subset of VQCs as quantum neural networks (QNNs) in analogy with classical neural networks. Indeed, there are cases where structures borrowed from classical neural networks, such as convolution layers, play an important role in VQCs. In such cases where the analogy is strong, QNNs may be a useful description. But parameterized quantum circuits need not follow the general structure of a neural network; for example, not all data need to be loaded in the first (input) layer; we can load some data in the first layer, apply some gates and then load additional data (a process called data \"reuploading\"). We should therefore think of QNNs as a subset of parameterized quantum circuits, and we should not be limited in our exploration of useful quantum circuits by the analogy to classical neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset being addressed in this lesson consists of images containing horizontal and vertical stripes, and our goal is to label unseen images into one of the two categories depending on the orientation of their line. We will accomplish this with a VQC. As we go, we will address ways in which the calculation can be improved and scaled. The dataset here is exceptionally easy to classify classically. It has been chosen for its simplicity so we can focus on the quantum part of this problem, and look at how a dataset attribute might translate to a part of a quantum circuit. It is not reasonable to expect a quantum speed-up for such simple cases where classical algorithms are so efficient.\n",

    "By the end of this lesson you should be able to:\n",
    "* Load data from an image into a quantum circuit\n",
    "* Construct an ansatz for a VQC (or QNN), and adjust it to fit your problem\n",
    "* Train your VQC/QNN and use it to make accurate predictions on test data\n",
    "* Scale the problem, and recognize limits of current quantum computers"

    "We will start by constructing the data. Data sets are often not explicitly generated as part of the Qiskit patterns framework. But data type and preparation is critical to successfully applying quantum computing to machine learning. The code below defines a data set of images with set pixel dimensions. One full row or column of the image is assigned the value $\\pi/2$, and the remaining pixels are assigned random values on the interval $(0,\\pi/4)$. The random values are noise in our data. Glance through the code to make sure you understand how the images are generated. Later on we will scale up the images."

    "We must now decide on an ansatz to be trained. There are many considerations when selecting an ansatz. A complete description is beyond the scope of this introduction; here we simply point out a few categories of considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hardware:** All modern quantum computers are more prone to errors and more susceptible to noise than their classical counterparts. Using an ansatz that is excessively deep (especially in transpiled, two-qubit depth) will not produce good results. A related issue is that quantum computers have some qubit layout, meaning that some physical qubits are adjacent on the quantum computer, and others may be very far from each other. Entangling adjacent qubits does not increase the depth by too much, but entangling very distant qubits can increase depth substantially, as we must insert swap gates to move information onto qubits that are adjacent in order for them to be entangled.\n",
    "2. **The problem:** Whenever you have some information about your problem that could guide your ansatz, make use of it. For example, the data in this lesson is made up of images of horizontal and vertical lines. One could consider what correlation between adjacent colors/values identifies an image of a horizontal or vertical line. What attributes of an ansatz would correspond to this correlation between adjacent pixels? We will revisit this point more technically later in this lesson. But for now, let us simply say that including entanglement and CNOT gates between qubits corresponding to adjacent pixels seems like a good idea. In the bigger picture, consider whether the problem is actually best solved using a quantum circuit, or whether classical algorithms might exist that can do as good a job.\n",
    "3. **Number of parameters:** Each independently parameterized quantum gate in the circuit increases the space to be classically optimized, and this results in slower convergence. But as problems scale up, one may encounter *barren plateaus*. This term refers to a phenomenon where the optimization landscape of a variational quantum algorithm becomes exponentially flat and featureless as the problem size increases. This causes vanishing gradients, making it difficult to effectively train the algorithm<sup>[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00781)</sup>. Barren plateaus are relevant to variational quantum algorithms like VQCs/QNNs. It should be noted that the increasing number of parameters is not the only consideration in avoiding barren plateaus; other considerations include global cost functions and random parameter initialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will see a few simple examples of good practices in ansatz construction. Let us first try the ansatz below. We will return to revise it, later."

In order to identify horizontal lines, we want to know \"if pixel $i$ is yellow, is pixel $i+1$ yellow\" for all the pixels across each row. We also want to know about vertical lines. But since the classification is binary, one could imagine simply saying that if such a horizontal line is *not* detected, then it is a vertical line. Our previous variational circuit contained CNOT gates between qubits (and therefore pixels) 0 & 1, 1 & 2, and 2 & 3. That covers any horizontal lines across the top of the image, but it does not directly detect vertical lines, nor does it completely detect horizontal lines, as it ignores the lower row. To fully detect all horizontal lines, we would want to have a similar set of CNOT gates between qubits (pixels) 4 & 5, 5 & 6, and 6 & 7. We could keep in mind that adding CNOT gates between qubits corresponding to vertical lines (like 0 & 4, or 2 & 6) may also be useful. But we will first check whether it is sufficient to detect that there *is* or *is not* a horizontal line."

    "You may note that if minimizing two-qubit depth were of paramount importance, we could actually reduce it a bit by changing the order of the CNOTs. For example, the CNOTs on $q_{35}$ and $q_{34}$ could be moved to the left in the circuit diagram above, and could be placed directly below the CNOTs on $q_{30}$ and $q_{31}$, for example. For a 2-qubit gate depth of 5, it isn't obvious that this will make a difference after transpilation, but it is something to keep in mind. If the order of the CNOT gates is important for logically matching the problem at hand, the depth here is fine. If the order of CNOTs is not critical to modeling the data structure in our images, then we could write a script to re-order these CNOT gates to minimize depth.\n",

    "We can plot these first few optimization steps, although we would not expect any convergence after just a few optimization steps. These curves have been relatively flat for the first few steps, even using simulators. We should note, however, that the optimization currently has 72 free parameters. This can be reduced by at least a factor of 2-3 without compromising results by, for example, parameterizing qubits with data corresponding to a subset of full rows and columns. Indeed, the parameter space should be reduced before spending more quantum computing time on minimizing the loss function."
