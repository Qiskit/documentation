    "## Ansatz code\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson you created a __Hamiltonian__ that describes the energy of your molecule of interest, and mapped it to a format useful for a quantum computer. The VQE uses a _variational circuit_ to prepare quantum states. We then use those states to determine the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (the energy). Parameters in the variational circuit are varied until the calculation converges on a minimum expectation value. In the quantum chemistry context, this should be the ground state energy. This lesson focuses on the variational circuit, also called the __ansatz__ (a German word meaning \"approach\" or \"method\").\n",
    "In this lesson you will learn\n",
    "- the set of pre-made ansaetze available in the circuit library\n",
    "- How to specify or modify the features of an ansatz\n",
    "- How to build your own ansatz\n",
    "- examples of good and bad ansaetze\n",
    "\n",
    "The Qiskit circuit library has many categories of circuits that can be used as an ansatz. Here, we will restrict our discussion to two-local circuits (circuits consisting of gates that act on, at most, two qubits at a time). __EfficientSU2__ is a commonly-used ansatz.\n",
    "\n",
    "An EfficientSU2 circuit consists of layers of single qubit operations spanned by SU(2) (special unity group of degree 2, like Pauli rotation gates) and CX entanglements. This is a heuristic pattern that can be useful in variational quantum algorithms like VQE and classification circuits in quantum machine learning (QML).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with a four-qubit example EfficientSU2 circuit with two types of SU(2) gates, say rx and ry. We also specify an entanglement scheme and the number of repetitions. If you simply `.draw()` the circuits, you will get a fairly abstract representation. A more comprehensible circuit diagram is obtained by using `.decompose().draw()`, and here we will use `output = \"mpl\"'."
