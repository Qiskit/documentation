# Overview

!["Hero image"](/learning/images/courses/quantum-chem-with-vqe/hero.svg)

Welcome to **Quantum chemistry with VQE**. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum algorithm with applications in quantum chemistry and simulation. In this introductory course, you will learn the basic building blocks of VQE, options in its implementation, and a few applications. Content is delivered through a combination of text, video, and code.

Principle topics include:

    - Hamiltonians
    - Ansaetze
    - Classical optimizers
    - Finding ground state energies using Qiskit patterns
    - Finding bond lengths using Qiskit patterns

This course focuses on applications to quantum chemistry, though many of the same building blocks (ansatz circuits, classical optimizers, and the Qiskit patterns framework) can be applied to a wide range of fields outside quantum chemistry.

## Helpful resources

This introduction to VQE is designed for intermediate learners of quantum computing techniques. No background in VQE is required. Familiarity with Qiskit, and some familiarity with quantum mechanics and related mathematics (such as operators) is assumed. We recommend devoting approximately 6-10 hours to completing this content, depending on one's prior experience.

    - The course on [Basics of Quantum Information](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/index) may be helpful in providing background and fundamentals of quantum information and computing.
