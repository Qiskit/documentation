    "## Coding a classical optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lessons, you learned to make a Hamiltonian suitable for use on a quantum computer and how to make a variational circuit. You also learned that the variational circuit (or ansatz) contains parameters to be varied, and the optimal choice of parameters is whatever yields the lowest possible cost function or energy. Thus, our problem is reduced to searching the  parameter space for the optimal set. Most of the work in classical optimizers has been done for us, as excellent optimizers are available from several sources.\n",

    "In this lesson you will learn:\n",
    "- How classical optimizers fit into a VQE calculation\n",
    "- What classical optimizers are available from SciPy\n",
    "- What optimizers are __not__ yet available through SciPy and how to supplement in the meantime using `qiskit.algorithms`\n",
    "- What options are available for these optimizers and the significance for quantum computing\n",

    "These algorithms have several options in common, but with subtle differences. For example, all have the option to specify a maximum number of iterations using the `'maxiter': 200` notation from above. All have some option specifying a different stopping criterion based on function or variable values, though these criteria are slightly different for different algorithms. Cobyla, for example, allows you to specify a tolerance (for example, `'tol': 0.0001`) that is the lower bound on a \"trust region\", determined by using gradients. In comparison, SLSQP lets you specify a goal in the precision of the function used in the stopping criterion ('ftol'). Nelder-Mead lets you specify a tolerance in the difference between successive parameter ($x$) guesses (xatol) or a tolerance in the difference between successive values obtained for the cost function $f(x)$ (fatol) (or both).\n",
