The highest optimization level is much smarter and uses lots of tricks to reduce the overall gate count. Since multi-qubit gates have high error rates and qubits decohere over time, the shorter circuits should give better results.\n",

In the session, we can set resilience and optimization levels. These tools are important enough that we include a brief review of each and their importance in VQE, with links to learn more:\n",

    "* Runtime sessions: VQE is inherently iterative, with the classical optimizer selecting new variational parameters, and thus new gates being used, in each subsequent trial. Without using sessions, this could result in additional queue time between each trial circuit. Encapsulating the VQE calculation inside a session results in only one initial queue prior to the job's start, but no additional queue time between variational steps. This strategy was already used in the previous lesson's example, but may play an even more important role when varying geometry. For more about sessions, review the  [execution modes documentation](/docs/guides/execution-modes).\n",

In many contexts (Estimator included), settings are limited to 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no optimization, and 1 (the default) indicating some optimization of your circuit to hardware selected. Some other contexts allow settings of  0, 1, 2, or 3. For more on the specific methods used in different settings, see the [documentation](/docs/api/qiskit-ibm-runtime/options-estimator-options). Here, we will actually set optimization to 0, and use 'skip\\_transpilation = true', because we have already transpiled our circuit using the pass manager above, in the optimization section.\n",
    "* Estimator's built-in resilience: As with optimization, Estimator has built-in settings for resilience against errors, corresponding to different approaches to error mitigation. To learn about resilience level settings, refer to the  [documentation](/docs/guides/configure-error-mitigation).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that error mitigation plays a nuanced role in the convergence of a VQE calculation. The classical optimizer is searching parameter space for those parameters that minimize the energy. When you are very far from the optimal parameters, a steep gradient may be apparent to the classical optimizer even in the presence of errors. But as the calculation converges and you approach the optimal values, the gradient becomes smaller, and more easily washed out by errors. How much error mitigation do you want to use? At what points in the convergence? These are choices you must make for your particular use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first hardware run, we have set resilience to 0 to facilitate a relatively fast run. For any serious application, you will want to use error mitigation. Note that in the cell below there are two sets of options: (1) options for the Runtime session, which we have named \"session\\_options\", and (2) options for the classical optimizer, simply called \"options\" here."
