    "We're now prepared to move on to quantum information in the setting of multiple systems.\n",
    "Much like in the previous lesson on single systems, the mathematical description of quantum information for multiple systems is quite similar to the probabilistic case and makes use of similar concepts and techniques.\n",

    "## Quantum states\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple systems can be viewed collectively as single, compound systems.\n",
    "We've already observed this in the probabilistic setting, and the quantum setting is analogous.\n",
    "Quantum states of multiple systems are therefore represented by column vectors having complex number entries and Euclidean norm equal to $1,$ just like quantum states of single systems.\n",
    "In the multiple system case, the entries of these vectors are placed in correspondence with the *Cartesian product* of the classical state sets associated with each of the individual systems, because that's the classical state set of the compound system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if $\\mathsf{X}$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$ are qubits, then the classical state set of the pair of qubits $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}),$ viewed collectively as a single system, is the Cartesian product $\\{0,1\\}\\times\\{0,1\\}.$\n",
    "By representing pairs of binary values as binary strings of length two, we associate this Cartesian product set with the set $\\{00,01,10,11\\}.$\n",
    "The following vectors are therefore all examples of quantum state vectors of the pair $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}):$\n",
