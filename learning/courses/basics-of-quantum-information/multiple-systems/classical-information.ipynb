    "# Classical information\n",
    "\n",
    "Like we did in the previous lesson, we'll begin this lesson with a discussion of classical information.\n",
    "Once again, the probabilistic and quantum descriptions are mathematically similar, and recognizing how the mathematics works in the familiar setting of classical information is helpful in understanding why quantum information is described in the way that it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classical states via the Cartesian product\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start at a very basic level, with classical states of multiple systems.\n",
    "For simplicity, we'll begin by discussing just two systems, and then generalize to more than two systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be precise, let $\\mathsf{X}$ be a system whose classical state set is $\\Sigma,$\n",
    "and let $\\mathsf{Y}$ be a second system whose classical state set is $\\Gamma.$\n",
    "Note that, because we have referred to these sets as *classical state sets*, our assumption is that $\\Sigma$ and $\\Gamma$ are both finite and nonempty.\n",
    "It could be that $\\Sigma = \\Gamma,$ but this is not necessarily so — and regardless, it will be helpful to use different names to refer to these sets in the interest of clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that the two systems, $\\mathsf{X}$ and $\\mathsf{Y},$ are placed side-by-side, with $\\mathsf{X}$ on the left and $\\mathsf{Y}$ on the right.\n",
    "If we so choose, we can view these two systems as if they form a single system, which we can denote by $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ or $\\mathsf{XY}$ depending on our preference.\n",
    "A natural question to ask about this compound system $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ is, \"What are its classical states?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that the set of classical states of $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ is the *Cartesian product* of $\\Sigma$ and $\\Gamma,$ which is the set defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\Sigma\\times\\Gamma = \\bigl\\{(a,b)\\,:\\,a\\in\\Sigma\\;\\text{and}\\;b\\in\\Gamma\\bigr\\}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, the Cartesian product is precisely the mathematical notion that captures the idea of viewing an element of one set and an element of a second set together, as if they form a single element of a single set.\n",
    "In the case at hand, to say that $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ is in the classical state $(a,b)\\in\\Sigma\\times\\Gamma$ means that $\\mathsf{X}$ is in the classical state $a\\in\\Sigma$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$ is in the classical state $b\\in\\Gamma;$\n",
    "and if the classical state of $\\mathsf{X}$ is $a\\in\\Sigma$ and the classical state of $\\mathsf{Y}$ is $b\\in\\Gamma,$ then the classical state of the joint system $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ is $(a,b).$\n",
    "\n",
    "For more than two systems, the situation generalizes in a natural way.\n",
    "If we suppose that $\\mathsf{X}_1,\\ldots,\\mathsf{X}_n$ are systems having classical state sets $\\Sigma_1,\\ldots,\\Sigma_n,$ respectively, for any positive integer $n,$ the classical state set of the $n$-tuple $(\\mathsf{X}_1,\\ldots,\\mathsf{X}_n),$ viewed as a single joint system, is the Cartesian product\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we are free to use whatever names we wish for systems, and to order them as we choose.\n",
    "In particular, if we have $n$ systems like above, we could instead choose to name them $\\mathsf{X}_{0},\\ldots,\\mathsf{X}_{n-1}$ and arrange them from right to left, so that the joint system becomes $(\\mathsf{X}_{n-1},\\ldots,\\mathsf{X}_0).$\n",
    "Following the same pattern for naming the associated classical states and classical state sets, we might then refer to a classical state\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(a_{n-1},\\ldots,a_0) \\in \\Sigma_{n-1}\\times \\cdots \\times \\Sigma_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "of this compound system.\n",
    "Indeed, this is the ordering convention used by Qiskit when naming multiple qubits.\n",
    "We'll come back to this convention and how it connects to quantum circuits in the next lesson, but we'll start using it now to help to get used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often convenient to write a classical state of the form $(a_{n-1},\\ldots,a_0)$ as a <DefinitionTooltip definition=\"A *string* is a finite, ordered sequence of symbols or characters.\">string</DefinitionTooltip> $a_{n-1}\\cdots a_0$ for the sake of brevity, particularly in the very typical situation that the classical state sets $\\Sigma_0,\\ldots,\\Sigma_{n-1}$ are associated with sets of *symbols* or *characters*.\n",
    "In this context, the term *alphabet* is commonly used to refer to sets of symbols used to form strings, but the mathematical definition of an alphabet is precisely the same as the definition of a classical state set: it is a finite and nonempty set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that $\\mathsf{X}_0,\\ldots,\\mathsf{X}_9$ are bits, so that the classical state sets of these systems are all the same.\n",

    "  \\Sigma_0 = \\Sigma_1 = \\cdots = \\Sigma_9 = \\{0,1\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are then $2^{10} = 1024$ classical states of the joint system $(\\mathsf{X}_9,\\ldots,\\mathsf{X}_0),$ which are the elements of the set\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\Sigma_9\\times\\Sigma_8\\times\\cdots\\times\\Sigma_0 = \\{0,1\\}^{10}.\n",

    "For the classical state $0000000110,$ for instance, we see that $\\mathsf{X}_1$ and $\\mathsf{X}_2$ are in the state $1,$ while all other systems are in the state $0.$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probabilistic states\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the previous lesson that a *probabilistic state* associates a probability with each classical state of a system.\n",
    "Thus, a probabilistic state of multiple systems — viewed collectively as a single system — associates a probability with each element of the Cartesian product of the classical state sets of the individual systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that $\\mathsf{X}$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$ are both bits, so that their corresponding classical state sets are $\\Sigma = \\{0,1\\}$ and $\\Gamma = \\{0,1\\},$ respectively.\n",
    "Here is a probabilistic state of the pair $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}):$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\operatorname{Pr}\\bigl( (\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}) = (0,0)\\bigr)\n",
    "    & = 1/2 \\\\[2mm]\n",
    "    \\operatorname{Pr}\\bigl( (\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}) = (0,1)\\bigr)\n",
    "    & = 0\\\\[2mm]\n",
    "    \\operatorname{Pr}\\bigl( (\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}) = (1,0)\\bigr)\n",
    "    & = 0\\\\[2mm]\n",
    "    \\operatorname{Pr}\\bigl( (\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}) = (1,1)\\bigr)\n",
    "    & = 1/2\n",
    "  \\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This probabilistic state is one in which both $\\mathsf{X}$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$ are random bits — each is $0$ with probability $1/2$ and $1$ with probability $1/2$ — but the classical states of the two bits always agree.\n",
    "This is an example of a *correlation* between these systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordering Cartesian product state sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic states of systems can be represented by probability vectors, as was discussed in the previous lesson.\n",
    "In particular, the vector entries represent probabilities for the system to be in the possible classical states of that system, and the understanding is that a correspondence between the entries and the set of classical states has been selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing such a correspondence effectively means deciding on an ordering of the classical states, which is often natural or determined by a standard convention.\n",
    "For example, the binary alphabet $\\{0,1\\}$ is naturally ordered with $0$ first and $1$ second, so the first entry in a probability vector representing a probabilistic state of a bit is the probability for it to be in the state $0,$ and the second entry is the probability for it to be in the state $1.$\n",
    "\n",
    "None of this changes in the context of multiple systems, but there is a decision to be made.\n",
    "The classical state set of multiple systems together, viewed collectively as a single system, is the Cartesian product of the classical state sets of the individual systems — so we must decide how the elements of Cartesian products of classical state sets are to be ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a simple convention that we follow for doing this, which is to start with whatever orderings are already in place for the individual classical state sets, and then to order the elements of the Cartesian product *alphabetically.*\n",
    "Another way to say this is that the entries in each $n$-tuple (or, equivalently, the symbols in each string) are treated as though they have significance that *decreases from left to right.*\n",
    "For example, according to this convention, the Cartesian product $\\{1,2,3\\}\\times\\{0,1\\}$ is ordered like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  (1,0),\\;\n",
    "  (1,1),\\;\n",
    "  (2,0),\\;\n",
    "  (2,1),\\;\n",
    "  (3,0),\\;\n",
    "  (3,1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $n$-tuples are written as strings and ordered in this way, we observe familiar patterns, such as $\\{0,1\\}\\times\\{0,1\\}$ being ordered as $00, 01, 10, 11,$ and the set $\\{0,1\\}^{10}$ being ordered as it was written earlier in the lesson.\n",
    "As another example, viewing the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\} \\times \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$ as a set of strings, we obtain the two-digit numbers $00$ through $99,$ ordered numerically.\n",
    "This is obviously not a coincidence;\n",
    "our decimal number system uses precisely this sort of alphabetical ordering, where the word *alphabetical* should be understood as having a broad meaning that includes numerals in addition to letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the example of two bits from above, the probabilistic state described previously is therefore represented by the following probability vector, where the entries are labeled explicitly for the sake of clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "    \\frac{1}{2}\\\\[1mm]\n",

    "### Independence of two systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A special type of probabilistic state of two systems is one in which the systems are *independent*.\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, two systems are independent if learning the classical state of either system has no effect on the probabilities associated with the other.\n",
    "That is, learning what classical state one of the systems is in provides no information at all about the classical state of the other.\n",
