    "Now we're ready to move on to quantum information, where we make a different choice for the type of vector that represents a state — in this case a *quantum state* — of the system being considered.\n",
    "Like in the previous discussion of classical information, we'll be concerned with systems having finite and nonempty sets of classical states, and we'll make use of much of the same notation.\n",

    "## Quantum state vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A *quantum state* of a system is represented by a column vector, similar to a probabilistic state. As before, the indices of the vector label the classical states of the system.\n",
    "Vectors representing quantum states are characterized by these two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The entries of a quantum state vector are *complex numbers*.\n",
    "2. The sum of the *absolute values squared* of the entries of a quantum state vector is $1.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in contrast to probabilistic states, vectors representing quantum states need not have nonnegative real number entries, and it is the sum of the absolute values squared of the entries (as opposed to the sum of the entries) that must equal $1.$ Simple as these changes are, they give rise to the differences between quantum and classical information; any speedup from a quantum computer, or improvement from a quantum communication protocol, is ultimately derived from these simple mathematical changes.\n",
