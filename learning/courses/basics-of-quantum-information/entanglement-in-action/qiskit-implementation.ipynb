    "Superdense coding is a protocol that, in some sense, achieves a complementary aim to teleportation.\n",
    "Rather than allowing for the transmission of one qubit using two classical bits of communication (at the cost of one e-bit of entanglement), it allows for the transmission of two classical bits using one qubit of quantum communication (again, at the cost of one e-bit of entanglement).\n",
    "\n",
    "In greater detail, we have a sender (Alice) and a receiver (Bob) that share one e-bit of entanglement.\n",
    "According to the conventions in place for the lesson, this means that Alice holds a qubit $\\mathsf{A},$ Bob holds a qubit $\\mathsf{B},$ and together the pair $(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B})$ is in the state $\\vert\\phi^+\\rangle.$\n",
    "Alice wishes to transmit two classical bits to Bob, which we'll denote by $c$ and $d,$ and she will accomplish this by sending him one qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is reasonable to view this feat as being less interesting than the one that teleportation accomplishes.\n",
    "Sending qubits is likely to be so much more difficult than sending classical bits for the foreseeable future that trading one qubit of quantum communication for two bits of classical communication, at the cost of an e-bit no less, hardly seems worth it.\n",
    "However, this does not imply that superdense coding is not interesting, for it most certainly is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting the theme of the lesson, one reason why superdense coding is interesting is that it demonstrates a concrete and (in the context of information theory) rather striking use of entanglement.\n",
    "A famous theorem in quantum information theory, known as *Holevo's theorem*, implies that without the use of a shared entangled state, it is impossible to communicate more than one bit of classical information by sending a single qubit.\n",
    "(Holevo's theorem is more general than this.\n",
    "Its precise statement is technical and requires explanation, but this is one consequence of it.)\n",
    "So, through superdense coding, shared entanglement effectively allows for the *doubling* of the classical information-carrying capacity of sending qubits."

    "\n",
    "The last example to be discussed in this lesson is not a protocol, but a *game* known as the\n",
    "*CHSH game*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we speak of a game in this context, we're not talking about something that's meant to be played for fun or sport, but rather a mathematical abstraction in the sense of *game theory*.\n",
    "Mathematical abstractions of games are studied in economics and computer science, for instance, and they are both fascinating and useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The letters CHSH refer to the authors — John Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard Holt — of a 1969 paper where the example was first described.\n",
    "They did not describe the example as a game, but rather as an experiment.\n",
    "Its description as a game, however, is both natural and intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CHSH game falls within a class of games known as *nonlocal games*.\n",
    "Nonlocal games are incredibly interesting and have deep connections to physics, computer science, and mathematics — holding mysteries that still remain unsolved.\n",
    "We'll begin the section by explaining what nonlocal games are, and then we'll focus in on the CHSH game and what makes it interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonlocal games\n",
    "\n",
    "A nonlocal game is a *cooperative game* where two players, Alice and Bob, work together to achieve a particular outcome.\n",
    "The game is run by a *referee*, who behaves according to strict guidelines that are known to Alice and Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob can prepare for the game however they choose, but once the game starts they are *forbidden from communicating*.\n",
    "We might imagine the game taking place in a secure facility of some sort — as if the referee is playing the role of a detective and Alice and Bob are suspects being interrogated in different rooms.\n",
    "But another way to think about the set-up is that Alice and Bob are separated by a vast distance, and communication is prohibited because the speed of light doesn't allow for it within the running time of the game.\n",
    "That is to say, if Alice tries to send a message to Bob, the game will be over by the time he receives it, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way a nonlocal game works is that the referee first asks Alice and Bob one question each.\n",
    "We'll use the letter $x$ to refer to Alice's question and $y$ to refer to Bob's question.\n",
    "Here we're thinking of $x$ and $y$ as being classical states, and in the CHSH game $x$ and $y$ are bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The referee uses *randomness* to select these questions.\n",
    "To be precise, there is some probability $p(x,y)$ associated with each possible pair $(x,y)$ of questions, and the referee has vowed to choose the questions randomly, at the time of the game, in this way.\n",
    "Everyone, including Alice and Bob, knows these probabilities — but nobody knows specifically which pair $(x,y)$ will be chosen until the game begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Alice and Bob receive their questions, they must then provide answers: Alice's answer is $a$ and Bob's answer is $b.$\n",
    "Again, these are classical states in general, and bits in the CHSH game.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point the referee makes a decision: Alice and Bob either *win* or *lose* depending on whether or not the pair of answers $(a,b)$ is deemed correct for the pair of questions $(x,y)$ according to some fixed set of rules.\n",
    "Different rules mean different games, and the rules for the CHSH game specifically are described in the section following this one.\n",
    "As was already suggested, the rules are known to everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram provides a graphic representation of the interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Nonlocal game](/learning/images/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/entanglement-in-action/qiskit-implementation/nonlocal-game.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the uncertainty about which questions will be asked, and specifically the fact that each player doesn't know the other player's question, that makes nonlocal games challenging for Alice and Bob — just like colluding suspects in different rooms trying to keep their story straight.\n",
    "\n",
    "A precise description of the referee defines an instance of a nonlocal game.\n",
    "This includes a specification of the probabilities $p(x,y)$ for each question pair along with the rules\n",
    "that determine whether each pair of answers $(a,b)$ wins or loses for each possible question pair $(x,y).$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take a look at the CHSH game momentarily, but before that let us briefly acknowledge that it's also interesting to consider other nonlocal games.\n",
    "In fact, it's extremely interesting; there are some pretty simple nonlocal games for which it's currently not known how well Alice and Bob can play using entanglement.\n",
    "The set-up is simple, but there's complexity at work — and for some games it can be impossibly difficult to compute best or near-best strategies for Alice and Bob.\n",
    "This is the surprisingly unintuitive nature of the nonlocal games model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CHSH game description\n",

    "### Limitation of classical strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider strategies for Alice and Bob in the CHSH game, beginning with *classical* strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deterministic strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start with *deterministic* strategies, where Alice's answer $a$ is a function of the question $x$ that she receives, and likewise Bob's answer $b$ is a function of the question $y$ he receives.\n",
    "So, for instance, we may write $a(0)$ to represent Alice's answer when her question is $0,$ and $a(1)$ to represent Alice's answer when her question is $1.$\n",
    "\n",
    "No deterministic strategy can possibly win the CHSH game every time.\n",
    "One way to understand this is simply to go one-by-one through all of the possible deterministic strategies and check that every one of them loses for at least one of the four possible question pairs.\n",
    "Alice and Bob can each choose from four possible functions from one bit to one bit — which we encountered in the lesson on [Single systems](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/single-systems/introduction) — and so there are $16$ different deterministic strategies in total to check.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also reason this analytically.\n",
    "If Alice and Bob's strategy wins when $(x,y) = (0,0),$ then it must be that $a(0) = b(0);$\n",
    "if their strategy wins when $(x,y) = (0,1),$ then $a(0) = b(1);$ and similarly,\n",
    "if the strategy wins for $(x,y)=(1,0)$ then $a(1) = b(0).$\n",
    "So, if their strategy wins for all three possibilities, then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "b(1) = a(0) = b(0) = a(1).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that the strategy loses in the final case $(x,y) = (1,1),$ and for here winning requires that\n",
    "$a(1) \\neq b(1).$\n",
    "Thus, there can be no deterministic strategy that wins every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it is easy to find deterministic strategies that win in three of the four cases, such as $a(0)=a(1)=b(0)=b(1)=0.$\n",
    "From this we conclude that the maximum probability for Alice and Bob to win using a deterministic strategy is $3/4.$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probabilistic strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "As we just concluded, Alice and Bob cannot do better than winning the CHSH game 75% of the time using a deterministic strategy.\n",
    "But what about a probabilistic strategy?\n",
    "Could it help Alice and Bob to use randomness — including the possibility of *shared randomness*, where their random choices are correlated?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that probabilistic strategies don't help at all to increase the probability that Alice and Bob win.\n",
    "This is because every probabilistic strategy can alternatively be viewed as a random selection of a deterministic strategy, just like (as was mentioned in the [Single systems](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/single-systems/introduction) lesson) probabilistic operations can be viewed as random selections of deterministic operations.\n",
    "The average is never larger than the maximum, and so it follows that probabilistic strategies don't offer any advantage in terms of their overall winning probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, winning with probability $3/4$ is the best that Alice and Bob can do using any classical strategy, whether deterministic or probabilistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CHSH game strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural question to ask at this point is whether Alice and Bob can do any better using a *quantum* strategy.\n",
    "In particular, if they share an entangled quantum state as the following figure suggests, which they could have prepared prior to playing the game, can they increase their winning probability?\n",

    "### Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of an experiment like the CHSH game, where entanglement leads to statistical results that are inconsistent with purely classical reasoning, is due to John Bell, the namesake of the Bell states.\n",
    "For this reason, people often refer to experiments of this sort as *Bell tests*.\n",
    "Sometimes people also refer to *Bell's theorem*, which can be formulated in different ways — but the essence of it is that quantum mechanics is not compatible with so-called *local hidden variable theories*.\n",
    "The CHSH game is a particularly clean and simple example of a Bell test, and can be viewed as a proof, or demonstration, of Bell's theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CHSH game offers a way to experimentally test the theory of quantum information.\n",
