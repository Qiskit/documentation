    "# Quantum teleportation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum teleportation, or just teleportation for short, is a protocol where a sender (Alice) transmits a qubit to a receiver (Bob) by making use of a shared entangled quantum state (one e-bit, to be specific) along with two bits of classical communication.\n",
    "The name *teleportation* is meant to be suggestive of the concept in science fiction where matter is transported from one location to another by a futuristic process, but it must be understood that matter is not teleported in quantum teleportation — what is actually teleported is quantum information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set-up for teleportation is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that Alice and Bob share an e-bit: Alice holds a qubit $\\mathsf{A},$ Bob holds a qubit $\\mathsf{B},$ and together the pair $(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B})$ is in the state $\\vert\\phi^+\\rangle.$\n",
    "It could be, for instance, that Alice and Bob were in the same location in the past, they prepared the qubits $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{B}$ in the state $\\vert \\phi^+ \\rangle,$ and then each went their own way with their qubit in hand.\n",
    "Or, it could be that a different process, such as one involving a third party or a complex distributed process, was used to establish this shared e-bit.\n",
    "These details are not part of the teleportation protocol itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice then comes into possession of a third qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ that she wishes to transmit to Bob.\n",
    "The state of the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ is considered to be *unknown* to Alice and Bob, and no assumptions are made about it.\n",
    "For example, the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ might be entangled with one or more other systems that neither Alice nor Bob can access.\n",
    "To say that Alice wishes to transmit the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ to Bob means that Alice would like Bob to be holding a qubit that is in the same state that $\\mathsf{Q}$ was in at the start of the protocol, having whatever correlations that $\\mathsf{Q}$ had with other systems, as if Alice had physically handed $\\mathsf{Q}$ to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could imagine that Alice physically sends the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ to Bob, and if it reaches Bob without being altered or disturbed in transit, then Alice and Bob's task will be accomplished.\n",
    "In the context of teleportation, however, it is our assumption that this is not feasible; Alice cannot send qubits directly to Bob.\n",
    "She may, however, send classical information to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are reasonable assumptions in a variety of settings.\n",
    "For example, if Alice doesn't know Bob's exact location, or the distance between them is large, physically sending a qubit using the technology of today, or the foreseeable future, would be challenging to say the least.\n",
    "However, as we know from everyday experiences, classical information transmission under these circumstances is quite straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, one might ask whether it is possible for Alice and Bob to accomplish their task without even needing to make use of a shared e-bit.\n",
    "In other words, is there any way to transmit a qubit using classical communication alone?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is no, it is not possible to transmit quantum information using classical communication alone.\n",
    "This is not too difficult to prove mathematically using basic quantum information theory, but we can alternatively rule out the possibility of transmitting qubits using classical communication alone by thinking about the no-cloning theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that there was a way to send quantum information using classical communication alone.\n",
    "Classical information can easily be copied and broadcast, which means that any classical transmission from Alice to Bob might also potentially be received by a second receiver (Charlie, let us say).\n",
    "But if Charlie receives the same classical communication that Bob received, then would he not also be able to obtain a copy of the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}?$\n",
    "This would suggest that $\\mathsf{Q}$ was cloned, which we already know is impossible from the no-cloning theorem, and so we conclude that there is no way to send quantum information using classical communication alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the assumption that Alice and Bob share an e-bit is in place, however, it is possible for Alice and Bob to accomplish their task.\n",
    "This is precisely what the quantum teleportation protocol does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quantum circuit diagram that describes the teleportation protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Teleportation circuit](/learning/images/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/entanglement-in-action/teleportation.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram is slightly stylized in that it depicts the separation between Alice and Bob, with two diagonal wires representing classical bits that are sent from Alice to Bob, but otherwise it is an ordinary quantum circuit diagram.\n",
    "The qubit names are shown above the wires rather than to the left so that the initial states can be shown as well (which we will commonly do when it is convenient).\n",
    "It should also be noted that the $X$ and $Z$ gates have *classical* controls, which simply means that the gates are not applied or applied depending on whether these classical control bits are $0$ or $1,$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, the teleportation protocol is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice performs a controlled-NOT operation on the pair $(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{Q}),$ with $\\mathsf{Q}$ being the control and $\\mathsf{A}$ being the target, and then performs a Hadamard operation on $\\mathsf{Q}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Alice then measures both $\\mathsf{A}$ and $\\mathsf{Q},$ with respect to a standard basis measurement in both cases, and transmits the classical outcomes to Bob. Let us refer to the outcome of the measurement of $\\mathsf{A}$ as $a$ and the outcome of the measurement of $\\mathsf{Q}$ as $b.$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bob receives $a$ and $b$ from Alice, and depending on the values of these bits he performs these operations:\n",
    "   - If $a = 1,$ then Bob performs a bit flip (or $X$ gate) on his qubit $\\mathsf{B}.$\n",
    "   - If $b = 1,$ then Bob performs a phase flip (or $Z$ gate) on his qubit $\\mathsf{B}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "   That is, conditioned on $ab$ being $00,$ $01,$ $10,$ or $11,$ Bob performs one of the operations $\\mathbb{I},$ $Z,$ $X,$ or $ZX$ on the qubit $\\mathsf{B}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the complete description of the teleportation protocol.\n",
    "The analysis that appears below reveals that when it is run, the qubit $\\mathsf{B}$ will be in whatever state $\\mathsf{Q}$ was in prior to the protocol being executed, including whatever correlations it had with any other systems — which is to say that the protocol has effectively implemented a perfect qubit communication channel, where the state of $\\mathsf{Q}$ has been \"teleported\" into $\\mathsf{B}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding to the analysis, notice that this protocol does not succeed in cloning the state of $\\mathsf{Q},$ which we already know is impossible by the no-cloning theorem.\n",
    "Rather, when the protocol is finished, the state of the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ will have changed from its original value to $\\vert b\\rangle$ as a result of the measurement performed on it.\n",
    "Also notice that the e-bit has effectively been \"burned\" in the process: the state of $\\mathsf{A}$ has changed to $\\vert a\\rangle$ and is no longer entangled with $\\mathsf{B}$ (or any other system).\n",
    "This is the cost of teleportation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the teleportation protocol, we'll examine the behavior of the circuit described above, one step at a time, beginning with the situation in which $\\mathsf{Q}$ is initially in the state $\\alpha\\vert 0\\rangle + \\beta\\vert 1\\rangle.$\n",
    "This is not the most general situation, as it does not capture the possibility that $\\mathsf{Q}$ is entangled with other systems, but starting with this simpler case will add clarity to the analysis.\n",
    "The more general case is addressed below, following the analysis of the simpler case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will consider the states of the qubits $(\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{Q})$ at the times suggested by this figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Teleportation circuit time-steps](/learning/images/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/entanglement-in-action/teleportation-time-steps.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the assumption that the qubit $\\mathsf{Q}$ begins the protocol in the state $\\alpha\\vert 0\\rangle + \\beta\\vert 1\\rangle,$ the state of the three qubits $(\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{Q})$ together at the start of the protocol is therefore\n",

    "First, teleportation is not an *application* of quantum information, it's a *protocol* for performing quantum communication.\n",
    "It is therefore useful only insofar as quantum communication is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, it is reasonable to speculate that teleportation could one day become a standard way to communicate quantum information, perhaps through a process known as *entanglement distillation*.\n",
    "This is a process that converts a larger number of noisy (or imperfect) e-bits into a smaller number of high quality e-bits, that could then be used for noiseless or near-noiseless teleportation.\n",
    "The idea is that the process of entanglement distillation is not as delicate as direct quantum communication.\n",
    "We could accept losses, for instance, and if the process doesn't work out, we can just try again.\n",
    "In contrast, the actual qubits we hope to communicate might be much more precious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it should be understood that the idea behind teleportation and the way that it works is quite fundamental in quantum information and computation.\n",
    "It really is a cornerstone of quantum information theory, and variations of it arise.\n",
    "For example, quantum gates can be implemented through a closely related process known as *quantum gate teleportation*, which uses teleportation to apply *operations* to qubits rather than communicating them."
