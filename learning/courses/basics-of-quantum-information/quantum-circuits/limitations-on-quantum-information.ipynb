    "# Limitations on quantum information\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite sharing a common underlying mathematical structure, quantum and classical information have key differences.\n",
    "As a result, there are many examples of tasks that quantum information allows but classical information does not.\n",

    "## Irrelevance of global phases\n",
    "\n",
    "The first limitation we'll cover — which is really more of a slight degeneracy in the way that quantum states are represented by quantum state vectors, as opposed to an actual limitation — concerns the notion of a *global phase*.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we mean by a global phase is this.\n",
    "Let $\\vert \\psi \\rangle$ and $\\vert \\phi \\rangle$ be unit vectors representing quantum states of some system, and suppose that there exists a complex number $\\alpha$ on the unit circle, meaning that $\\vert \\alpha \\vert = 1,$ or alternatively $\\alpha = e^{i\\theta}$ for some real number $\\theta,$ such that\n",

    "any number on the unit circle can be thought of as a global phase when multiplied to a unit vector.\n",

    "There are, in fact, statements of the no-cloning theorem that place limitations on approximate cloning, as well as methods to achieve approximate cloning with limited accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second remark is that the no-cloning theorem is a statement about the impossibility of cloning an *arbitrary* state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle.$\n",
    "In contrast, we can easily create a clone of any standard basis state, for instance.\n",
    "For example, we can clone a qubit standard basis state using a controlled-NOT operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Classical copy](/learning/images/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits/cNOT-copy.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is no difficulty in creating a clone of a standard basis state, this does not contradict the no-cloning theorem.\n",
    "This approach of using a controlled-NOT gate would not succeed in creating a clone of the state $\\vert + \\rangle,$ for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final remark about the no-cloning theorem is that it really isn't unique to quantum information — it's also impossible to clone an arbitrary probabilistic state using a classical (deterministic or probabilistic) process.\n",
    "Imagine someone hands you a system in some probabilistic state, but you're not sure what that probabilistic state is.\n",
    "For example, maybe they randomly generated a number between $1$ and $10,$ but they didn't tell you how they generated that number.\n",
    "There's certainly no physical process through which you can obtain two *independent* copies of that same probabilistic state: all you have in your hands is a number between $1$ and $10,$ and there just isn't enough information present for you to somehow reconstruct the probabilities for all of the other outcomes to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, a version of the no-cloning theorem for probabilistic states can be proved in exactly the same way as the regular no-cloning theorem (for quantum states).\n",
    "That is, cloning an arbitrary probabilistic state is a non-linear process, so it cannot possibly be represented by a stochastic matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-orthogonal states cannot be perfectly discriminated\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final limitation to be covered in this lesson, we'll show that if we have two quantum states $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ and $\\vert\\phi\\rangle$ that are not orthogonal, which means that $\\langle \\phi\\vert\\psi\\rangle \\neq 0,$ then it's impossible to discriminate them (or, in other words, to tell them apart) perfectly.\n",
    "In fact, we'll show something logically equivalent: if we do have a way to discriminate two states perfectly, without any error, then they must be orthogonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll restrict our attention to quantum circuits that consist of any number of unitary gates, followed by a single standard basis measurement of the top qubit.\n",
    "What we require of a quantum circuit, to say that it perfectly discriminates the states $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ and $\\vert\\phi\\rangle,$ is that the measurement always yields the value $0$ for one of the two states and always yields $1$ for the other state.\n",
