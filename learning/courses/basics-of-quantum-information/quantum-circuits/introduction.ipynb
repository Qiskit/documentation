    "This lesson introduces the *quantum circuit* model of computation, which provides a standard way to describe quantum computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson also introduces a few important mathematical concepts, including *inner products* between vectors, the notions of *orthogonality* and *orthonormality*, and *projections* and *projective measurements*, which generalize standard basis measurements.\n",
    "Through these concepts, we'll derive fundamental limitations on quantum information, including the *no-cloning theorem* and the impossibility to perfectly discriminate non-orthogonal quantum states."
