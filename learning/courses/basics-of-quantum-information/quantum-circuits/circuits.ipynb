    "In computer science, *circuits* are models of computation in which information is carried by wires through a network of *gates*, which represent operations on the information carried by the wires.\n",
    "*Quantum circuits* are a specific model of computation based on this more general concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the word \"circuit\" often refers to a circular path, circular paths aren't actually allowed in the circuit models of computation that are most commonly studied.\n",
    "That is to say, we usually consider *acyclic circuits* when we're thinking about circuits as computational models.\n",
    "Quantum circuits follow this pattern; a quantum circuit represents a finite sequence of operations that cannot contain feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Boolean circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a (classical) Boolean circuit, where the wires carry binary values and the gates represent Boolean logic operations:\n",

    "The flow of information along the wires goes from left to right: the wires on the left-hand side of the figure labeled $\\mathsf{X}$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$ are input bits, which can each be set to whatever binary value we choose, and the wire on the right-hand side is the output.\n",
    "The intermediate wires take whatever values are determined by the gates, which are evaluated from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gates are AND gates (labeled $\\wedge$), OR gates (labeled $\\vee$), and NOT gates (labeled $\\neg$).\n",
    "The functions computed by these gates will likely be familiar to many readers, but here they are represented by tables of values:\n",

    "Fan-out operations are not always considered to be gates in the classical setting; sometimes they're treated as if they're \"free\" in some sense.\n",
    "When Boolean circuits are converted into equivalent quantum circuits, however, we do need to classify fan-out operations explicitly as gates to handle and account for them correctly.\n",

    "## Other types of circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "As was suggested above, the notion of a circuit in computer science is very general.\n",
    "For example, circuits whose wires carry values other than $0$ and $1$ are sometimes analyzed, as are gates representing different choices of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *arithmetic circuits*, for instance, the wires may carry integer values while the gates represent arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication.\n",
    "The following figure depicts an arithmetic circuit that takes two variable input values ($x$ and $y$) as well as a third input set to the value $1.$\n",
    "The values carried by the wires, as functions of the values $x$ and $y,$ are shown in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example arithmetic circuit](/learning/images/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits/arithmetic-circuit.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also consider circuits that incorporate randomness, such as ones where gates represent probabilistic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "In the quantum circuit model, wires represent qubits and gates represent operations on these qubits.\n",
    "We'll focus for now on operations we've encountered so far, namely *unitary operations* and *standard basis measurements*.\n",
    "As we learn about other sorts of quantum operations and measurements, we can enhance our model accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a quantum circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Simple quantum circuit](/learning/images/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits/simple-quantum-circuit.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this circuit, we have a single qubit named $\\mathsf{X},$ which is represented by the horizontal line, and a sequence of gates representing unitary operations on this qubit.\n",
    "Just like in the examples above, the flow of information goes from left to right — so the first operation performed is a Hadamard operation, the second is an $S$ operation, the third is another Hadamard operation, and the final operation is a $T$ operation.\n",
    "Applying the entire circuit therefore applies the composition of these operations, $T H S H,$ to the qubit $\\mathsf{X}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we may wish to explicitly indicate the input or output states of circuits.\n",
    "For example, if we apply the operation $T H S H$ to the state $\\vert 0\\rangle,$ we obtain the state\n",
    "$\\frac{1+i}{2}\\vert 0\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\vert 1 \\rangle.$ This can be indicated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Simple quantum circuit evaluated](/learning/images/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits/simple-quantum-circuit-evaluated.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum circuits often start out with all qubits initialized to $\\vert 0\\rangle,$ as we have in this case, but there are also situations where the input qubits are initially set to different states.\n",
    "Here's another example of a quantum circuit, this time with two qubits:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Quantum circuit that creates an e-bit](/learning/images/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/quantum-circuits/ebit-circuit.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, the gate labeled $H$ refers to a Hadamard operation, while the second gate is a *controlled-NOT* operation: the solid circle represents the *control qubit* and the circle resembling the symbol $\\oplus$ denotes the *target qubit.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before examining this circuit in greater detail and explaining what it does, it is imperative that we first clarify how qubits are ordered in quantum circuits.\n",
    "This connects with the convention that Qiskit uses for naming and ordering systems that was mentioned briefly in the previous lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Admonition type=\"note\" title=\"Qiskit's qubit ordering convention for circuits\">\n",
    "In Qiskit, the *topmost* qubit in a circuit diagram has index $0$ and corresponds to the *rightmost* position in a tuple of qubits (or in a string, Cartesian product, or tensor product corresponding to this tuple), the *second-from-top* qubit has index $1,$ and corresponds to the position *second-from-right* in a tuple, and so on. The *bottommost* qubit, which has the highest index, therefore corresponds to the *leftmost* position in a tuple. In particular, Qiskit's default names for the qubits in an $n$-qubit circuit are represented by the $n$-tuple $(\\mathsf{q_{n-1}},\\ldots,\\mathsf{q_{0}}),$ with $\\mathsf{q_{0}}$ being the qubit on the top and $\\mathsf{q_{n-1}}$ on the bottom in quantum circuit diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please be aware that this is a reversal of a more common convention for ordering qubits in circuits, and is a frequent source of confusion.\n",
    "Further information on this ordering convention can be found on the [Bit-ordering in Qiskit](/docs/guides/bit-ordering) documentation page.\n",
    "</Admonition>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we sometimes deviate from the specific default names $\\mathsf{q_{0}},\\ldots,\\mathsf{q_{n-1}}$ used for qubits by Qiskit, we will always follow the ordering convention described above when interpreting circuit diagrams throughout this course.\n",
    "Thus, our interpretation of the circuit above is that it describes an operation on a pair of qubits $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y}).$\n",
    "If the input to the circuit is a quantum state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle \\otimes \\vert\\phi\\rangle,$ for instance, then this means that the lower qubit $\\mathsf{X}$ starts in the state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ and the upper qubit $\\mathsf{Y}$ starts in the state $\\vert\\phi\\rangle.$\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what the circuit does, we can go from left to right through its operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first operation is a Hadamard operation on $\\mathsf{Y}$:\n",

    "   When applying a gate to a single qubit like this, nothing happens to the other qubits (which is just one other qubit in this case). Nothing happening is equivalent to the identity operation being performed. The dotted rectangle in the figure above therefore represents this operation:\n",
