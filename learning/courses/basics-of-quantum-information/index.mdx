# Overview

!["Hero image"](/learning/images/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/hero.svg)

Welcome to *Basics of Quantum Information,* the first course in the *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation* series comprising the following courses:

- Basics of quantum information (this course)
- [Fundamentals of quantum algorithms](/learning/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/index)
- [General formulation of quantum information](/learning/courses/general-formulation-of-quantum-information/index)
- [Foundations of quantum error correction](/learning/courses/foundations-of-quantum-error-correction/index)

This course begins with an introduction to the mathematics of quantum information, including a description of quantum information for both single and multiple systems. It then moves on to quantum circuits, which provide a standard way to describe quantum computations. Finally, three fundamentally important examples connected with the phenomenon of quantum entanglement are explained: quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and the CHSH game (also known as the CHSH inequality).

This course is intended for students, professionals, and hobbyists in fields such as computer science, physics, engineering, and mathematics who are eager to gain knowledge on the theoretical foundations of quantum information and computation.

## Recommended background

To make the most out of this course, we recommend familiarity with basic linear algebra, complex numbers, and elementary mathematical notions including sets and functions. The following sources are a few among many that cover this material:

- [Khan Academy: Linear algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)

   In this video series, Sal Khan introduces key concepts in linear algebra that we will rely upon.

- Stephen Friedberg, Arnold Insel, and Lawrence Spence. [Linear Algebra ](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/linear-algebra/P200000006185/9780137515424)

   This book on linear algebra covers the material we require, and also includes appendices on sets, functions, and complex numbers.

- Sheldon Axler. [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-11080-6)

   A classic text on linear algebra suitable for those at or beyond an advanced undergraduate level.

- Ricky Shadrach and Rod Pierce. [Introduction to Sets](https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/sets-introduction.html)

   A beginner-level web page on sets that may help to bring some readers up to speed.

- John K. Hunter. [An Introduction to Real Analysis: Chapter 1](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/intro_analysis_pdf/ch1.pdf)

   The first chapter of these lecture notes includes a more formal and detailed introduction to sets and functions.
