    "\n",
    "*Naimark's theorem* is a fundamental fact concerning measurements.\n",
    "It states that every general measurement can be implemented in a simple way that's reminiscent of Stinespring representations of channels:\n",
    "1. The system to be measured is first combined with an initialized workspace system, forming a compound system.\n",
    "2. A unitary operation is then performed on the compound system.\n",
    "3. Finally, the workspace system is *measured* with respect to a *standard basis measurement*, yielding the outcome of the original general measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theorem statement and proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathsf{X}$ be a system and let $\\{P_0,\\ldots,P_{m-1}\\}$ be a collection of positive semidefinite matrices satisfying\n",

    "Also let $\\mathsf{Y}$ be a system whose classical state set is $\\{0,\\ldots,m-1\\},$ which is the set of possible outcomes of this measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naimark's theorem states that there exists a unitary operation $U$ on the compound system $(\\mathsf{Y},\\mathsf{X})$ so that the implementation suggested by the following figure yields measurement outcomes that agree with the given measurement $\\{P_0,\\ldots,P_{m-1}\\},$ meaning that the probabilities for the different possible measurement outcomes are precisely in agreement.\n",

    "To be clear, the system $\\mathsf{X}$ starts out in some arbitrary state $\\rho$ while $\\mathsf{Y}$ is initialized to the $\\vert 0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "The unitary operation $U$ is applied to $(\\mathsf{Y},\\mathsf{X})$ and then the system $\\mathsf{Y}$ is measured with a standard basis measurement, yielding some outcome $a\\in\\{0,\\ldots,m-1\\}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "The system $\\mathsf{X}$ is pictured as part of the output of the circuit, but for now we won't concern ourselves with the state of $\\mathsf{X}$ after $U$ is performed, and can imagine that it is traced out.\n",
    "We'll be interested in the state of $\\mathsf{X}$ after $U$ is performed later in the lesson, though.\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of a measurement in this way is clearly reminiscent of a Stinespring representation of a channel, and the mathematical underpinnings are similar as well.\n",
    "The difference here is that the workspace system is measured rather than being traced out like in the case of a Stinespring representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that every measurement can be implemented in this way is pretty simple to prove, but we're going to need a fact concerning positive semidefinite matrices first.\n",

    "\n",
    "In general, for a given destructive measurement, there will be multiple (in fact infinitely many) non-destructive measurements that are *compatible* with the given destructive measurement, meaning that the classical measurement outcome probabilities match precisely with the destructive measurement.\n",
    "So, there isn't a unique way to define the post-measurement quantum state of a system for a given measurement.\n",
    "It is, in fact, possible to generalize non-destructive measurements even further, so that they produce a classical measurement outcome along with a quantum state output of a system that isn't necessarily the same as the input system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of a non-destructive measurement is an interesting and useful abstraction.\n",
