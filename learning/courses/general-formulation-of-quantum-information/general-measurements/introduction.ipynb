    "Measurements provide an interface between quantum and classical information.\n",
    "When a measurement is performed on a system in a quantum state, classical information is extracted, revealing something about that quantum state â€” and generally changing or destroying it in the process.\n",
    "In the simplified formulation of quantum information (as presented in the *Basics of quantum information* course), we typically limit our attention to *projective measurements*, including the simplest type of measurement: *standard basis measurements*.\n",
    "The concept of a measurement, however, can be generalized beyond projective measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll consider measurements in greater generality.\n",
    "We'll discuss a few different ways that general measurements can be described in mathematical terms, and we'll connect them to concepts discussed previously in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also take a look at a couple of notions connected with measurements, namely *quantum state discrimination* and *quantum state tomography*.\n",
    "Quantum state discrimination refers to a situation that arises commonly in quantum computing and cryptography, where a system is prepared in one of a known collection of states, and the goal is to determine, by means of a measurement, which state was prepared.\n",
    "For quantum state tomography, on the other hand, many independent copies of a single, unknown quantum state are made available, and the goal is to reconstruct a density matrix description of that state by performing measurements on the copies.\n",
