    "# Quantum state discrimination and tomography\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last part of the lesson, we'll briefly consider two tasks associated with measurements: *quantum state discrimination* and *quantum state tomography*.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Quantum state discrimination*\n",
    "\n",
    "   For quantum state discrimination, we have a known collection of quantum states $\\rho_0,\\ldots,\\rho_{m-1},$ along with\n",
    "   probabilities $p_0,\\ldots,p_{m-1}$ associated with these states.\n",
    "   A succinct way of expressing this is to say that we have an *ensemble*\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\{(p_0,\\rho_0),\\ldots,(p_{m-1},\\rho_{m-1})\\}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   of quantum states.\n",
    "\n",
    "   A number $a\\in\\{0,\\ldots,m-1\\}$ is chosen randomly according to the probabilities $(p_0,\\ldots,p_{m-1})$ and the system $\\mathsf{X}$\n",
    "   is prepared in the state $\\rho_a.$\n",
    "   The goal is to determine, by means of a measurement of $\\mathsf{X}$ alone, which value of $a$ was chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Thus, we have a finite number of alternatives, along with a *prior* — which is our knowledge of the probability for each $a$ to\n",
    "   be selected — and the goal is to determine which alternative actually happened.\n",
    "   This may be easy for some choices of states and probabilities, and for others it may not be possible without some chance of making an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Quantum state tomography*\n",
    "\n",
    "   For quantum state tomography, we have an *unknown* quantum state of a system —\n",
    "   so unlike in quantum state discrimination there's typically no prior or any\n",
    "   information about possible alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This time, however, it's not a single copy of the state that's made available,\n",
    "   but rather many *independent* copies are made available.\n",
    "   That is, $N$ identical systems $\\mathsf{X}_1,\\ldots,\\mathsf{X}_N$ are each\n",
    "   independently prepared in the state $\\rho$ for some (possibly large) number $N.$\n",
    "   The goal is to find an approximation of the unknown state, as a density matrix,\n",
    "   by measuring the systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discriminating between two states\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest case for quantum state discrimination is that there are two states,\n",
    "$\\rho_0$ and $\\rho_1,$ that are to be discriminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a situation which a bit $a$ is chosen randomly: $a = 0$ with probability $p$ and $a = 1$ with probability $1 - p.$\n",
    "A system $\\mathsf{X}$ is prepared in the state $\\rho_a,$ meaning $\\rho_0$ or $\\rho_1$ depending on the value of $a,$ and given to us.\n",
    "Our goal is to correctly guess the value of $a$ by means of a measurement on $\\mathsf{X}.$\n",
    "To be precise, we shall aim to maximize the probability that our guess is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An optimal measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal way to solve this problem begins with a spectral decomposition of a weighted difference between $\\rho_0$ and $\\rho_1,$ where the weights are the corresponding probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p \\rho_0 - (1-p) \\rho_1 = \\sum_{k = 0}^{n-1} \\lambda_k \\vert \\psi_k \\rangle \\langle \\psi_k \\vert\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have a minus sign rather than a plus sign in this expression: this is a weighted *difference* not a weighted sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can maximize the probability of a correct guess by selecting a projective measurement $\\{\\Pi_0,\\Pi_1\\}$ as follows.\n",
    "First let's partition the elements of $\\{0,\\ldots,n-1\\}$ into two disjoint sets $S_0$ and $S_1$ depending upon whether the corresponding eigenvalue of the weighted difference is nonnegative or negative.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{gathered}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then choose a *projective* measurement as follows.\n",

    "\n",
    "This is an optimal measurement in the situation at hand that minimizes the probability of an incorrect determination of the selected state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correctness probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will determine the probability of correctness for the measurement $\\{\\Pi_0,\\Pi_1\\}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin we don't really need to be concerned with the specific choice we've made for $\\Pi_0$ and $\\Pi_1,$ though it may be helpful to keep it in mind.\n",

    "Based on the sequence of measurement outcomes, a guess $\\tilde{\\rho}$ for the state $\\rho$ is derived — and again there are different methodologies for doing this.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is to perform a single *joint measurement* of the entire collection, where we think about $(\\mathsf{X}_1,\\ldots,\\mathsf{X}_N)$ as a single system and select a single measurement whose output is a guess $\\tilde{\\rho}$ for the state $\\rho.$\n",
    "This can lead to an improved estimate over what is possible for separate measurements of the individual systems, although a joint measurement on all of the systems together is likely to be much more difficult to implement.\n",
