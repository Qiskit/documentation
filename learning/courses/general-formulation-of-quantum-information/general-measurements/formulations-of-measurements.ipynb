    "# Mathematical formulations of measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "The lesson begins with two equivalent mathematical descriptions of measurements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. General measurements can be described by *collections of matrices*, one for each measurement outcome, in a way that generalizes the description of projective measurements.\n",
    "2. General measurements can be described as *channels* whose outputs are always classical states (represented by diagonal density matrices).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll restrict our attention to measurements having *finitely many* possible outcomes.\n",
    "Although it is possible to define measurements with infinitely many possible outcomes, they're much less typically encountered in the context of computation and information processing, and they also require some additional mathematics (namely measure theory) to be properly formalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial focus will be on so-called *destructive* measurements, where the output of the measurement is a classical measurement outcome alone â€” with no specification of the post-measurement quantum state of whatever system was measured.\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, we can imagine that such a measurement destroys the quantum system itself, or that the system is immediately discarded once the measurement is made.\n",
    "Later in the lesson we'll broaden our view and consider *non-destructive* measurements, where there's both a classical measurement outcome and a post-measurement quantum state of the measured system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measurements as collections of matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $\\mathsf{X}$ is a system that is to be measured, and assume for simplicity that the classical state set of $\\mathsf{X}$ is $\\{0,\\ldots, n-1\\}$ for some positive integer $n,$ so that density matrices representing quantum states of $\\mathsf{X}$ are $n\\times n$ matrices.\n",
    "We won't actually have much need to refer to the classical states of $\\mathsf{X},$ but it will be convenient to refer to $n,$ the number of classical states of $\\mathsf{X}.$\n",
    "We'll also assume that the possible outcomes of the measurement are the integers $0,\\ldots,m-1$ for some positive integer $m.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we're just using these names to keep things simple;\n",
    "it's straightforward to generalize everything that follows to other finite sets of classical states and measurement outcomes, renaming them as desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projective measurements\n",
    "\n",

    "We also have that the post-measurement state of $\\mathsf{X}$ is obtained by normalizing the vector $\\Pi_a\\vert\\psi\\rangle,$ but we're ignoring the post-measurement state for now.\n",

    "\n",
    "A mathematical description for general measurements is obtained by relaxing the definition of projective measurements.\n",
    "Specifically, we allow the matrices in the collection describing the measurement to be arbitrary *positive semidefinite* matrices rather than projections.\n",
    "(Projections are always positive semidefinite; they can alternatively be defined as positive semidefinite matrices whose eigenvalues are all either 0 or 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, a general measurement of a system $\\mathsf{X}$ having outcomes $0,\\ldots,m-1$ is specified by a collection of positive semidefinite matrices $\\{P_0,\\ldots,P_{m-1}\\}$ whose rows and columns correspond to the classical states of $\\mathsf{X}$ and that meet the condition\n",

    "Putting these observations together, we find that the two descriptions of general measurements are equivalent.\n",
