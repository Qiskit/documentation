    "# Bloch sphere\n",

    "There's a useful geometric way to represent qubit states known as the *Bloch sphere*.\n",
    "It's very convenient, but unfortunately it only works for qubits — the analogous representation no longer corresponds to a spherical object once we have three or more classical states of our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qubit states as points on a sphere\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by thinking about a quantum state vector of a qubit: $\\alpha \\vert 0\\rangle + \\beta \\vert 1\\rangle.$\n",
    "We can restrict our attention to vectors for which $\\alpha$ is a nonnegative real number because every qubit state vector is equivalent up to a global phase to one for which $\\alpha \\geq 0.$\n",
    "This allows us to write\n",

    "\n",
    "for two real numbers $\\theta \\in [0,\\pi]$ and $\\phi\\in[0,2\\pi).$\n",
    "Here, we're allowing $\\theta$ to range from $0$ to $\\pi$ and dividing by $2$ in the argument of sine and cosine because this is a conventional way to parameterize vectors of this sort, and it will make things simpler a bit later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it isn't quite the case that the numbers $\\theta$ and $\\phi$ are uniquely determined by a given quantum state vector $\\alpha \\vert 0\\rangle + \\beta \\vert 1\\rangle,$ but it is nearly so.\n",
    "In particular, if $\\beta = 0,$ then $\\theta = 0$ and it doesn't make any difference what value $\\phi$ takes, so it can be chosen arbitrarily.\n",
    "Similarly, if $\\alpha = 0,$ then $\\theta = \\pi,$ and once again $\\phi$ is irrelevant (as our state is equivalent to $e^{i\\phi}\\vert 1\\rangle$ for any $\\phi$ up to a global phase).\n",
    "If, however, neither $\\alpha$ nor $\\beta$ is zero, then there's a unique choice for the pair $(\\theta,\\phi)$ for which $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is equivalent to $\\alpha\\vert 0\\rangle + \\beta\\vert 1\\rangle$ up to a global phase.\n",
