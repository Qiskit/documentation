    "Similar to what we had for state vectors, tensor products of density matrices represent *independence* between the states of multiple systems.\n",
    "For instance, if $\\mathsf{X}$ is prepared in the state represented by the density matrix $\\rho$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$ is independently prepared in the state represented by $\\sigma,$ then the density matrix describing the state of $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ is the tensor product $\\rho\\otimes\\sigma.$\n",

    "States that cannot be expressed as product states represent *correlations* between systems.\n",

    "2. *Ensembles of quantum states.*\n",
    "   Suppose we have $m$ density matrices $\\rho_0,\\ldots,\\rho_{m-1},$ all representing states of a system $\\mathsf{X},$ and we  randomly choose one of these states according to a probability vector $(p_0,\\ldots,p_{m-1}).$ Such a process is represented by an *ensemble* of states, which includes the specification of the density matrices $\\rho_0,\\ldots,\\rho_{m-1},$ as well as the probabilities $(p_0,\\ldots,p_{m-1}).$ We can associate an ensemble of states with a single density matrix, describing both the random choice of $k$ and the corresponding density matrix $\\rho_k,$ like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "   \\sum_{k = 0}^{m-1} p_k \\vert k\\rangle \\langle k \\vert \\otimes \\rho_k.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   To be clear, this is the state of a pair $(\\mathsf{Y},\\mathsf{X})$ where $\\mathsf{Y}$ represents the classical selection of $k$ — so we're assuming its classical state set is $\\{0,\\ldots,m-1\\}.$ States of this form are sometimes called *classical-quantum states*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Separable states*. We can imagine situations in which we have a classical correlation among the quantum states of two systems like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",

This concept can also be extended to more than two systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Entangled states*. Not all states of pairs of systems are separable. In the general formulation of quantum information, this is how entanglement is defined: states that are not separable are said to be *entangled*.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Note that this terminology is consistent with the terminology we used in the \"Basics of quantum information\" course. There we said that quantum state vectors that are not product states represent entangled states — and indeed, for any quantum state vector $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ that is not a product state, we find that the state represented by the density matrix $\\vert\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi\\vert$ is not separable. Entanglement is much more complicated than this for states that are not pure.\n",

    "## Reduced states and the partial trace\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a simple but important thing we can do with density matrices in the context of multiple systems, which is to describe the states we obtain by ignoring some of the systems.\n",
    "When multiple systems are in a quantum state and we discard or choose to ignore one or more of the systems,\n",
    "the state of the remaining systems is called the *reduced state* of those systems.\n",
    "Density matrix descriptions of reduced states are easily obtained through a mapping, known as the *partial trace*, from the density matrix describing the state of the whole.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, it might seem like the density matrix description of Alice's qubit in isolation that we've just obtained relies on the assumption that Bob has measured his qubit, but this is not actually so.\n",
    "What we've done is to use the possibility that Bob measures his qubit to argue that the completely mixed state arises as the state of Alice's qubit, based on what we've already learned.\n",
    "Of course, nothing says that Bob must measure his qubit — but nothing says that he doesn't.\n",
    "And if he's light years away, then nothing he does or doesn't do can possibly influence the state of Alice's qubit viewed it in isolation.\n",
    "That is to say, the description we've obtained for the state of Alice's qubit is the only description consistent with the impossibility of faster-than-light communication.\n",
