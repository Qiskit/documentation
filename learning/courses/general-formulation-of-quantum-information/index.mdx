Welcome to *General Formulation of Quantum Information,* the third course in the *Understanding Quantum Information and Computation* series comprising the following courses:

- [Basics of quantum information](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information)
- [Fundamentals of quantum algorithms](/learning/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms)
- General formulation of quantum information (this course)
- [Foundations of quantum error correction](/learning/courses/foundations-of-quantum-error-correction)

This course describes the general formulation of quantum information, where quantum states are represented by *density matrices,*
changes in states are described by *channels,* and a more general class of *measurements* can be considered than those discussed in
*Basics of quantum information.* The course also discusses mathematical ways of formalizing the *distance* or *similarity* between
quantum states, and how they relate to channels and measurements in operational ways.

This course is intended for students, professionals, and hobbyists in fields such as computer science, physics, engineering, and
mathematics who are eager to gain knowledge on the theoretical foundations of quantum information and computation.
