    "# Fidelity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the lesson, we'll discuss the *fidelity* between quantum states, which is a measure of their similarity — or how much they \"overlap.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two quantum state vectors, the fidelity between the pure states associated with these quantum state vectors equals the absolute value of the inner product between the quantum state vectors.\n",
    "This provides a basic way to measure their similarity: the result is a value between $0$ and $1,$ with larger values indicating greater similarity.\n",
    "In particular, the value is zero for orthogonal states (by definition), while the value is $1$ for states equivalent up to a global phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively speaking, the fidelity can be seen as an extension of this basic measure of similarity, from quantum state vectors to density matrices.\n",

    "## Definition of fidelity\n",
    "\n",
    "It's fitting to begin with a definition of fidelity.\n",
    "At first glance, the definition that follows might look unusual or mysterious, and perhaps not easy to work with.\n",
    "The function it defines, however, turns out to have many interesting properties and multiple alternative formulations, making it much nicer to work with than it may initially appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Figure title=\"Definition\">\n",
    "Let $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ be density matrices representing quantum states of the same system.\n",
    "The *fidelity* between $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ is defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\operatorname{F}(\\rho,\\sigma) = \\operatorname{Tr}\\sqrt{\\sqrt{\\rho} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\rho}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "</Figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "<Figure title=\"Remark\">\n",
    "Although this is a common definition, it is also common that the fidelity is defined as the *square* of the quantity defined here, which is then referred to as the *root-fidelity*.\n",
    "Neither definition is right or wrong — it's essentially a matter of preference.\n",
    "Nevertheless, one must always be careful to understand or clarify which definition is being used.\n",
    "</Figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sense of the formula in the definition, notice first that $\\sqrt{\\rho} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\rho}$ is a positive semidefinite matrix:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\sqrt{\\rho} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\rho} = M^{\\dagger} M\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for $M = \\sqrt{\\sigma}\\sqrt{\\rho}.$\n",
    "Like all positive semidefinite matrices, this positive semidefinite matrix has a unique positive semidefinite square root, the trace of which is the fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every square matrix $M,$ the eigenvalues of the two positive semidefinite matrices $M^{\\dagger} M$ and $M M^{\\dagger}$ are always the same, and hence the same is true for the square roots of these matrices.\n",
    "Choosing $M = \\sqrt{\\sigma}\\sqrt{\\rho}$ and using the fact that the trace of a square matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues, we find that\n",

    "### Fidelity for pure states\n",
    "\n",
    "One last point on the definition of fidelity is that every pure state is (as a density matrix) equal to its own square root, which allows the formula for the fidelity to be simplified considerably when one or both of the states is pure.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Basic properties of fidelity\n",
    "\n",
    "The fidelity has many remarkable properties and several alternative formulations.\n",
    "Here are just a few basic properties listed without proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For any two density matrices $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ having the same size, the fidelity $\\operatorname{F}(\\rho,\\sigma)$ lies between zero and one: $0\\leq \\operatorname{F}(\\rho,\\sigma) \\leq 1.$ It is the case that $\\operatorname{F}(\\rho,\\sigma)=0$ if and only if $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ have orthogonal images (so they can be discriminated without error), and $\\operatorname{F}(\\rho,\\sigma)=1$ if and only if $\\rho = \\sigma.$\n",
    "2. The fidelity is *multiplicative,* meaning that the fidelity between two product states is equal to the product of the individual fidelities:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\operatorname{F}(\\rho_1\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\rho_m,\\sigma_1\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes\\sigma_m)\n",
    "   = \\operatorname{F}(\\rho_1,\\sigma_1)\\cdots \\operatorname{F}(\\rho_m,\\sigma_m).\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "3. The fidelity between states is nondecreasing under the action of any channel. That is, if $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ are density matrices and $\\Phi$ is a channel that can take these two states as input, then it is necessarily the case\n",
    "that\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\operatorname{F}(\\rho,\\sigma) \\leq \\operatorname{F}(\\Phi(\\rho),\\Phi(\\sigma)).\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "4. The *Fuchs-van de Graaf inequalities* establish a close (though not exact) relationship between fidelity and trace distance: for any two states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ we have\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\rho - \\sigma\\|_1 \\leq \\operatorname{F}(\\rho,\\sigma)\n",
    "   \\leq \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\|\\rho - \\sigma\\|_1^2}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The final property can be expressed in the form of a figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A plot relating trace distance and fidelity](/learning/images/courses/general-formulation-of-quantum-information/purifications-and-fidelity/FvdG-plot.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, for any choice of states $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ of the same system, the horizontal line that crosses the $y$-axis at $\\operatorname{F}(\\rho,\\sigma)$ and the vertical line that crosses the $x$-axis at $\\frac{1}{2}\\|\\rho-\\sigma\\|_1$ must intersect within the gray region bordered below by the line $y = 1-x$ and above by the unit circle.\n",
    "The most interesting region of this figure from a practical viewpoint is the upper left-hand corner of the gray region:\n",
    "if the fidelity between two states is close to one, then their trace distance is close to zero, and *vice versa*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gentle measurement lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll take a look at a simple but important fact, known as the *gentle measurement lemma*, which connects fidelity to non-destructive measurements.\n",
    "It's a very useful lemma that comes up from time to time, and it's also noteworthy because the seemingly clunky definition for the fidelity actually makes the lemma very easy to prove.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set-up is as follows.\n",
    "Let $\\mathsf{X}$ be a system in a state $\\rho$ and let $\\{P_0,\\ldots,P_{m-1}\\}$ be a collection of positive semidefinite matrices representing a general measurement of $\\mathsf{X}.$\n",
    "Suppose further that if this measurement is performed on the system $\\mathsf{X}$ while it's in the state $\\rho,$ one of the outcomes is highly likely.\n",

    "What the gentle measurement lemma states is that, under these assumptions, the non-destructive measurement obtained from $\\{P_0,\\ldots,P_{m-1}\\}$ through Naimark's theorem causes only a small disturbance to $\\rho$ in case the likely measurement outcome $0$ is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the lemma states that the fidelity-squared between $\\rho$ and the state we obtain from the non-destructive measurement, conditioned on the outcome being $0,$ is greater than $1-\\varepsilon.$\n",

    "This follows from the fact that, for any unit vector $\\vert\\psi\\rangle,$ the value\n",
    "$\\langle \\psi \\vert P_a \\vert \\psi \\rangle$ is a nonnegative real number for each $a\\in\\{0,\\ldots,m-1\\}$ (because each $P_a$ is positive semidefinite), together with these numbers summing to one.\n",
