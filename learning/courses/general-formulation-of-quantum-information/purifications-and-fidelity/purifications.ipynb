    "## Definition of purifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with a precise mathematical definition for purifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "<Figure title=\"Definition\">\n",
    "Suppose $\\mathsf{X}$ is a system in a state represented by a density matrix $\\rho,$ and $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is a quantum state vector of a pair $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ that leaves $\\rho$ when $\\mathsf{Y}$ is traced out:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho = \\operatorname{Tr}_{\\mathsf{Y}} \\bigl( \\vert \\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi\\vert\\bigr).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The state vector $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is then said to be a *purification* of $\\rho.$\n",
    "</Figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The pure state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi\\vert,$ expressed as a density matrix rather than a quantum state vector, is also commonly referred to as a purification of $\\rho$ when the equation in the definition is true, but we'll generally use the term to refer to a quantum state vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term *purification* is also used more generally when the ordering of the systems is reversed, when the names of the systems and states are different (of course), and when there are more than two systems.\n",
    "For instance, if $\\vert \\psi \\rangle$ is a quantum state vector representing a pure state of a compound system $(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{B},\\mathsf{C}),$ and the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho = \\operatorname{Tr}_{\\mathsf{B}} \\bigl(\\vert\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi\\vert\\bigr)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is true for a density matrix $\\rho$ representing a state of the system $(\\mathsf{A},\\mathsf{C}),$ then $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is still referred to as a purification of $\\rho.$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this lesson, however, we'll focus on the specific form described in the definition.\n",
    "Properties and facts concerning purifications, according to this definition, can typically be generalized to more than two systems by re-ordering and partitioning the systems into two compound systems, one playing the role of $\\mathsf{X}$ and the other playing the role of $\\mathsf{Y}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Existence of purifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that $\\mathsf{X}$ and $\\mathsf{Y}$ are any two systems and $\\rho$ is a given state of $\\mathsf{X}.$\n",
    "We will prove that there exists a quantum state vector $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ of $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ that *purifies* $\\rho$ — which is another way of saying that $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is a purification of $\\rho$ — provided that the system $\\mathsf{Y}$ is large enough.\n",
    "In particular, if $\\mathsf{Y}$ has at least as many classical states as $\\mathsf{X},$ then a purification of this form necessarily exists for every state $\\rho.$\n",
    "Fewer classical states of $\\mathsf{Y}$ are required for some states $\\rho;$\n",
    "in general, $\\operatorname{rank}(\\rho)$ classical states of $\\mathsf{Y}$ are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a quantum state vector of $(\\mathsf{X},\\mathsf{Y})$ that purifies $\\rho.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider first any expression of $\\rho$ as a convex combination of $n$ pure states, for any positive integer $n.$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho = \\sum_{a = 0}^{n-1} p_a \\vert\\phi_a\\rangle\\langle\\phi_a\\vert\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression, $(p_0,\\ldots,p_{n-1})$ is a probability vector and $\\vert\\phi_0\\rangle,\\ldots,\\vert\\phi_{n-1}\\rangle$ are quantum state vectors of $\\mathsf{X}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to obtain such an expression is through the spectral theorem, in which case $n$ is the number of classical states of $\\mathsf{X},$ $p_0,\\ldots,p_{n-1}$ are the eigenvalues of $\\rho,$ and $\\vert\\phi_0\\rangle,\\ldots,\\vert\\phi_{n-1}\\rangle$ are orthonormal eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's actually no need to include the terms corresponding to the zero eigenvalues of $\\rho$ in the sum, which allows us to alternatively choose $n = \\operatorname{rank}(\\rho)$ and $p_0,\\ldots,p_{n-1}$ to be the non-zero eigenvalues of $\\rho.$\n",
    "This is the minimum value of $n$ for which an expression of $\\rho$ taking the form above exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, it is *not necessary* that the chosen expression of $\\rho,$ as a convex combination of pure states, comes from the spectral theorem — this is just one way to obtain such an expression.\n",
    "In particular, $n$ could be any positive integer, the unit vectors $\\vert\\phi_0\\rangle,\\ldots,\\vert\\phi_{n-1}\\rangle$ need not be orthogonal, and the probabilities $p_0,\\ldots,p_{n-1}$ need not be eigenvalues of $\\rho.$\n",

    "### Cryptographic implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The unitary equivalence of purifications has implications concerning the implementation of cryptographic primitives using quantum information.\n",
    "For instance, the unitary equivalence of purifications reveals that it is impossible to implement an ideal form of *bit commitment* using quantum information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bit commitment primitive involves two participants, Alice and Bob (who don't trust one another), and has two phases.\n",
    "- The first phase is the *commit* phase, through which Alice commits to a binary value $b\\in\\{0,1\\}.$\n",
    "This commitment must be *binding*, which means that Alice cannot change her mind, as well as *concealing*, which means that Bob can't tell which value Alice has committed to.\n",
    "- The second phase is the *reveal* phase, in which the bit committed by Alice becomes known to Bob, who should then be convinced that it was truly the committed value that was revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In intuitive, operational terms, the first phase of bit commitment should function as if Alice writes a binary value on a piece of paper, locks the paper inside of a safe, and gives the safe to Bob while keeping the key for herself.\n",
    "Alice has committed to the binary value written on the paper because the safe is in Bob's possession (so it's binding), but because Bob can't open the safe he can't tell which value Alice committed to (so it's concealing).\n",
    "The second phase should work as if Alice hands the key to the safe to Bob, so that he can open the safe to reveal the value to which Alice committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, it is impossible to implement a perfect bit commitment protocol by means of quantum information alone, for this contradicts the unitary equivalence of purifications.\n",
    "Here is a high-level summary of an argument that establishes this.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we can assume Alice and Bob only perform unitary operations or introduce new initialized systems as the protocol is executed.\n",
    "The fact that every channel has a Stinespring representation allows us to make this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the commit phase of the protocol, Bob holds in his possession some compound system that must be in one of two quantum states: $\\rho_0$ if Alice committed to the value $0$ and $\\rho_1$ if Alice committed to the value $1.$\n",
    "In order for the protocol to be perfectly concealing, Bob should not be able to tell the difference between these two states — so it must be that $\\rho_0 = \\rho_1.$\n",
    "(Otherwise there would be a measurement that discriminates these states probabilistically.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because Alice and Bob have only used unitary operations, the state of all of the systems involved in the protocol together after the commit phase must be in a pure state.\n",
    "In particular, suppose that $\\vert\\psi_0\\rangle$ is the pure state of all of the systems involved in the protocol when Alice commits to $0,$ and $\\vert\\psi_1\\rangle$ is the pure state of all of the systems involved in the protocol when Alice commits to $1.$\n",
