    "Linear mappings from vectors to vectors can be represented by matrices in a familiar way, where the action of the linear mapping is described by matrix-vector multiplication.\n",
    "But channels are linear mappings from matrices to matrices, not vectors to vectors.\n",
    "So, *in general*, how can we express channels in mathematical terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "For some channels, we may have a simple formula that describes them, like for the three examples of non-unitary qubit channels described previously.\n",
    "But an arbitrary channel may not have such a nice formula, so it isn't practical in general to express a channel in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a point of comparison, in the simplified formulation of quantum information we use *unitary matrices* to represent operations on quantum state vectors: every unitary matrix represents a valid operation and every valid operation can be expressed as a unitary matrix.\n",
    "In essence, the question being asked is: How can we do something analogous for channels?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we'll require some additional mathematical machinery.\n",
    "We'll see that channels can, in fact, be described mathematically in a few different ways, including representations named in honor of three individuals who played key roles in their development:\n",

    "\n",
    "Stinespring representations are based on the idea that every channel can be implemented in a standard way,\n",
    "where an input system is first combined with an initialized workspace system, forming a compound system;\n",
    "then a unitary operation is performed on the compound system;\n",
    "and finally the workspace system is discarded (or traced out), leaving the output of the channel.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this diagram the wires represent arbitrary systems, as indicated by the labels above the wires, and not necessarily single qubits.\n",
    "Also, the *ground* symbol commonly used in electrical engineering indicates explicitly that $\\mathsf{W}$ is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "In words, the way the implementation works is as follows.\n",
    "The input system $\\mathsf{X}$ begins in some state $\\rho,$ while a workspace system $\\mathsf{W}$ is initialized to the standard basis state $\\vert 0\\rangle.$\n",
    "A unitary operation $U$ is performed on the pair $(\\mathsf{W},\\mathsf{X}),$ and finally the workspace system $\\mathsf{W}$ is *traced out*, leaving $\\mathsf{X}$ as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we're presuming that $0$ is a classical state of $\\mathsf{W},$ and we choose it to be the initialized state of this system, which will help to simplify the mathematics.\n",
    "One could, however, choose any fixed pure state to represent the initialized state of $\\mathsf{W}$ without changing\n",
    "the basic properties of the representation.\n",

    "As usual, we're using Qiskit's ordering convention:\n",
    "the system $\\mathsf{X}$ is on top in the diagram, and therefore corresponds to the right-hand tensor factor in the formula.\n",

    "In general, the input and output systems of a channel need not be the same.\n",

    "This time the unitary operation transforms $(\\mathsf{W},\\mathsf{X})$ into a pair $(\\mathsf{G},\\mathsf{Y}),$ where $\\mathsf{G}$ is a new \"garbage\" system that gets traced out, leaving $\\mathsf{Y}$ as the output system.\n",
    "In order for $U$ to be unitary, it must be a square matrix.\n",
    "This requires that the pair $(\\mathsf{G},\\mathsf{Y})$ has the same number of classical states as the pair $(\\mathsf{W},\\mathsf{X}),$ and so the systems $\\mathsf{W}$ and $\\mathsf{G}$ must be chosen in a way that allows this.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's not at all obvious, but every channel does in fact have a Stinespring representation, as we will see by the end of the lesson.\n",
