    "# Equivalence of the representations\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now discussed three different ways to represent channels in mathematical terms, namely Stinespring representations, Kraus representations, and Choi representations.\n",
    "We also have the definition of a channel, which states that a channel is a linear mapping that always transforms density matrices into density matrices, even when the channel is applied to just part of a compound system.\n",
    "The remainder of the lesson is devoted to a mathematical proof that the three representations are equivalent and precisely capture the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to establish the equivalence of a collection of four statements, and we'll begin by writing them down precisely.\n",
    "All four statements follow the same conventions that have been used throughout the lesson, namely that $\\Phi$ is a linear mapping from square matrices to square matrices, the rows and columns of the input matrices have been placed in correspondence with the classical states of a system $\\mathsf{X}$ (the input system), and the rows and columns of the output matrices have been placed in correspondence with the classical states of a system $\\mathsf{Y}$ (the output system).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\Phi$ is a channel from $\\mathsf{X}$ to $\\mathsf{Y}.$ That is, $\\Phi$ always transforms density matrices to density matrices, even when it acts on one part of a larger compound system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Choi matrix $J(\\Phi)$ is positive semidefinite and satisfies the condition $\\operatorname{Tr}_{\\mathsf{Y}}(J(\\Phi)) = \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathsf{X}}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There is a Kraus representation for $\\Phi.$ That is, there exist matrices $A_0,\\ldots,A_{N-1}$ for which the equation $\\Phi(\\rho) = \\sum_{k = 0}^{N-1} A_k \\rho A_k^{\\dagger}$ is true for every input $\\rho,$ and that satisfy the condition $\\sum_{k = 0}^{N-1} A_k^{\\dagger} A_k = \\mathbb{I}_{\\mathsf{X}}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There is a Stinespring representation for $\\Phi.$ That is, there exist systems $\\mathsf{W}$ and $\\mathsf{G}$ for which the pairs $(\\mathsf{W},\\mathsf{X})$ and $(\\mathsf{G},\\mathsf{Y})$ have the same number of classical states, along with a unitary matrix $U$ representing a unitary operation from $(\\mathsf{W},\\mathsf{X})$ to $(\\mathsf{G},\\mathsf{Y}),$ such that $\\Phi(\\rho) = \\operatorname{Tr}_{\\mathsf{G}}\\bigl( U (\\vert 0\\rangle\\langle 0 \\vert \\otimes \\rho) U^{\\dagger} \\bigr).$\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the proof works is that a cycle of implications is proved:\n",
    "the first statement in our list implies the second, the second implies the third, the third implies the fourth, and the fourth statement implies the first.\n",
    "This establishes that all four statements are equivalent — which is to say that they're either all true or all false for a given choice of $\\Phi$ — because the implications can be followed transitively from any one statement to any other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common strategy when proving that a collection of statements are equivalent, and a useful trick to use in such a context is to set up the implications in a way that makes them as easy to prove as possible.\n",
    "That is the case here — and in fact we've already encountered two of the four implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channels to Choi matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Referring to the statements listed above by their numbers, the first implication to be proved is 1 $\\Rightarrow$ 2.\n",
    "This implication was already discussed in the context of the Choi state of a channel.\n",
    "Here we'll summarize the mathematical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the classical state set of the input system $\\mathsf{X}$ is $\\Sigma$ and let $n = \\vert\\Sigma\\vert.$\n",
