    "# Quantum channel basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical terms, channels are linear mappings from density matrices to density matrices that satisfy certain requirements.\n",
    "Throughout this lesson we'll use uppercase Greek letters, including $\\Phi$ and $\\Psi,$ as well as some other letters in specific cases, to refer to channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every channel $\\Phi$ has an input system and an output system, and we'll typically use the name $\\mathsf{X}$ to refer to the input system and $\\mathsf{Y}$ to refer to the output system.\n",
    "It's common that the output system of a channel is the same as the input system, and in this case we can use the same letter $\\mathsf{X}$ to refer to both.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channels are linear mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "Channels are described by *linear* mappings, just like probabilistic operations in the standard formulation of classical information and unitary operations in the simplified formulation of quantum information.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a channel $\\Phi$ is performed on an input system $\\mathsf{X}$ whose state is described by a density matrix $\\rho,$ then the output system of the channel is described by the density matrix $\\Phi(\\rho).$\n",
    "In the situation in which the output system of $\\Phi$ is also $\\mathsf{X},$ we can simply view that the channel represents a change in the state of $\\mathsf{X},$ from $\\rho$ to $\\Phi(\\rho).$\n",
    "When the output system of $\\Phi$ is a different system, $\\mathsf{Y},$ rather than $\\mathsf{X},$ it should be understood that $\\mathsf{Y}$ is a new system that is created by the process of applying the channel, and that the input system, $\\mathsf{X},$ is no longer available once the channel is applied — as if the channel itself transformed $\\mathsf{X}$ into $\\mathsf{Y},$ leaving it in the state $\\Phi(\\rho).$\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption that channels are described by *linear* mappings can be viewed as being an axiom — or in other words, a basic postulate of the theory rather than something that is proved.\n",
    "We can, however, see the need for channels to act linearly on convex combinations of density matrix inputs in order for them to be consistent with probability theory and what we've already learned about density matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, suppose that we have a channel $\\Phi$ and we apply it to a system when it's in one of the two states represented by the density matrices $\\rho$ and $\\sigma.$\n",
    "If we apply the channel to $\\rho$ we obtain the density matrix $\\Phi(\\rho)$ and if we apply it to $\\sigma$ we obtain the density matrix $\\Phi(\\sigma).$\n",
    "Thus, if we randomly choose the input state of $\\mathsf{X}$ to be $\\rho$ with probability $p$ and $\\sigma$ with probability $1-p,$ we'll obtain the output state $\\Phi(\\rho)$ with probability $p,$ and $\\Phi(\\sigma)$ with probability $1-p,$ which we represent by a weighted average of density matrices as $p\\Phi(\\rho) + (1-p)\\Phi(\\sigma).$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we could think about the input state of the channel as being represented by the weighted average $p\\rho + (1-p)\\sigma,$ in which case the output is $\\Phi(p\\rho + (1-p)\\sigma).$\n",
    "It's the same state regardless of how we choose to think about it, so we must have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Phi(p\\rho + (1-p)\\sigma) = p\\Phi(\\rho) + (1-p)\\Phi(\\sigma).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we have a mapping that satisfies this condition for every choice of density matrices $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ and scalars $p\\in [0,1],$ there's always a unique way to extend that mapping to every matrix input (i.e., not just density matrix inputs) so that it's linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Channels transform density matrices into density matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, in addition to being linear mappings, channels must also transform density matrices into density matrices.\n",
    "If a channel $\\Phi$ is applied to an input system while this system is in a state represented by a density matrix $\\rho,$ then we obtain a system whose state is represented by $\\Phi(\\rho),$ which must be a valid density matrix in order for us to interpret it as a state.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is critically important, though, that we consider a more general situation, where a channel $\\Phi$ transforms a system $\\mathsf{X}$ into a system $\\mathsf{Y}$ in the presence of an additional system $\\mathsf{Z}$ to which nothing happens.\n",
    "That is, if we start with the pair of systems $(\\mathsf{Z},\\mathsf{X})$ in a state described by some density matrix, and then apply $\\Phi$ just to $\\mathsf{X},$ transforming it into $\\mathsf{Y},$ we must obtain a density matrix describing a state of the pair $(\\mathsf{Z},\\mathsf{Y}).$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe in mathematical terms how a channel $\\Phi,$ having an input system $\\mathsf{X}$ and an output system $\\mathsf{Y},$ transforms a state of the pair $(\\mathsf{Z},\\mathsf{X})$ into a state of $(\\mathsf{Z},\\mathsf{Y})$ when nothing is done to $\\mathsf{Z}.$\n",
    "To keep things simple, we'll assume that the classical state set of $\\mathsf{Z}$ is $\\{0,\\ldots,m-1\\}.$\n",

    "\n",

    "These are both important properties that can be considered and studied separately, but it isn't critical for the sake of this lesson to consider these properties in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, in fact, linear mappings that always output a density matrix when given a density matrix as input, but fail to map density matrices to density matrices for compound systems, so we do eliminate some linear mappings from the class of channels in this way.\n",

    "Any linear mapping that satisfies the requirement that it always transforms density matrices into density matrices, even when it's applied to just one part of a compound systems, represents a valid channel.\n",
    "So, in an abstract sense, the notion of a channel is determined by the notion of a density matrix, together with the assumption that channels act linearly.\n",
    "In this regard, channels are analogous to unitary operations in the simplified formulation of quantum information, which are precisely the linear mappings that always transform quantum state vectors to quantum state vectors for a given system; as well as to probabilistic operations (represented by stochastic matrices) in the standard formulation of classical information, which are precisely the linear mappings that always transform probability vectors into probability vectors.\n",
