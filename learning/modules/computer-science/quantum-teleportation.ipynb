    "## Introduction and background\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum teleportation is a technique in quantum physics that allows the transfer of quantum information from one location to another without physically moving particles. Unlike the sci-fi concept of teleportation, this process doesn't involve transporting matter. Instead, it relies on the principle of quantum entanglement, where two particles become linked regardless of distance. Through a series of precise measurements and classical communication, the quantum state of one particle can be recreated in another particle at a distant location, effectively \"teleporting\" the quantum information. In this module, we'll see how this works mathematically, and then we will implement quantum teleportation on a real quantum computer. The introduction here will be brief; for more background on quantum information, and more explanation about teleportation, we recommend John Watrous's course on the [Basics of quantum information](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information), and in particular the section on [Teleportation.](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/entanglement-in-action/quantum-teleportation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical bits can be in states 0 or 1. Quantum bits (qubits) can be in quantum states denoted $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ and also linear combinations of these states, called \"superpositions\", such as $|\\psi\\rangle = \\alpha_0|0\\rangle +\\alpha_1|1\\rangle$, with $\\alpha_0,\\alpha_1 \\in \\mathbb{C},$ and $|\\alpha_0|^2+|\\alpha_1|^2 = 1.$ Although the states can exist in this superposition, a measurement of the state will \"collapse\" it into either the $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ states. The parameters $a$ and $b$ are related to the probability of each measurement outcome according to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "P_1 = |\\alpha_1|^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the constraint that $|\\alpha_0|^2+|\\alpha_1|^2 = 1.$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key feature is that quantum bits can be \"entangled\", which means that the measurement of one qubit can affect the outcome of the measurement of another, entangled qubit. Understanding how entanglement is different from simple classical correlations is a bit tricky. Let's first explain our notation. Call two qubits belonging to friend 0 (Alice) and friend 1 (Bob), and each in the $|0\\rangle$ state\n",

    "$$\n",
    "|0\\rangle_B|0\\rangle_A\n",

    "sometimes shortened to simply\n",

    "|00\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the lowest-numbered (or lettered) qubit is furthest to the right. This is a convention called \"little-endian\" notation, used throughout Qiskit.\n",
    "If the two-qubit state of the friends is $|00\\rangle,$ and they measure the state of their respective qubits, they will each find a 0. Similarly if the qubits were in the state $|11\\rangle,$ each of their measurements would yield a 1. That is no different from the classical case. However, in quantum computing, we can combine this with superposition to obtain states like\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle+|11\\rangle)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a state like this, whether Alice and Bob have qubits in the state 0 or 1 is not yet known, not even yet determined by nature, and yet we know they will measure the same state for their qubit. For example, if Bob measures his qubit to be in the state $|0\\rangle,$ the only way for that to happen is if the measurement has collapsed the two-qubit state to one of the two possible states, specifically to $|00\\rangle.$ That leaves Alice's qubit also in the $|0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entangled of qubits in this way does not require that the qubits remain physically close to one another. In other words, we could entangle qubits, then separate them by a large distance, and use their entanglement to send information. An entangled state like the one above is a basic unit of entanglement, and is sometimes referred to as an \"e-bit\", a single bit of entanglement. These e-bits can be thought of as resources in quantum communication, since each e-bit shared between distant partners can be used, as we outline here, to move information from one location to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thought for many people learning about this for the first time is about violating relativity: can we use this to send information faster than light? By all means, keep questioning and probing scientific rules, but unfortunately this won't allow us to send information faster than light, for reasons that will become clear through the course of this module. Spoiler: amazingly it is NOT due to the speed at which this collapse propagates, which does appear to happen faster than light [[1]](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15759)."

This is because we added a gate to undo the initial preparation of the secret state. If the secret state was successfully teleported to Bob's qubit, that additional gate should return Bob's qubit to the $|0\\rangle$ state. So any state above with Bob's qubit (qubit 0, also measured to the 0th component of the classical register, and hence the highest/right-most) in the $|0\\rangle$ state indicates success.\n",

In little-endian notation, Bob's qubit is the left-most/lowest. So the four bars on the left correspond to Bob's qubit being $|0\\rangle$, and the other two qubits being in all possible combinations with roughly equal probability. Note that almost all (usually \\~95%) of measurements yield Bob's qubit in the $|0\\rangle$ state, meaning our setup was successful! There are a handful of shots (\\~5%) that yielded Bob's qubit in the $|1\\rangle$ state. That should not logically be possible.

    "You can see in the circuit diagram that the logical steps are the same. The only difference is that we used the swap gates to bring Alice's qubit's state from qubit 6 ($A_5$) up to qubit 1 ($A_0$), right next to Q. And we used swap gates to bring Bob's initial state from qubit 7 ($B_0$) down to qubit 12 ($B_5$). Note that the state on qubit 12 is not even related to Q's secret state until measurements are made on the distant qubits 0 and 1, and the state on qubit 12 is not equal to the secret state until after the conditional $X$ and $Z$ gates are applied.\n",

In this case, there is no computational reason for us to transfer states from qubits 6 and 7 over to qubits 1 and 12. That was just something we did to demonstrate teleportation over a distance. If we ask the pass manager to optimize our circuit, it will realize there is no logical reason for these swap gates, and it will remove them and carry out the gate operations on adjacent qubits. So for this special case, we use ```optimization_level = 0```."

    "Again we see that the probabilities for the possible outcomes for Alice's qubits are fairly uniform. There is a strong preference for finding Bob's qubit in $|0\\rangle$ after inverting the secret code, meaning there is a strong probability that we correctly teleported the secret state across the processor from Q to Bob (qubits 0 to 12). However, we note that there is now about a higher chance of *not* measuring $|0\\rangle$ for Bob. This is an important lesson in quantum computing: the more gates you have, especially multi-qubit gates like swap gates, the more noise and errors you will encounter."

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Qubits can be entangled, meaning a measurement of one qubit affects or even determines the state of another qubit.\n",
    "- Entanglement differs from classical correlations; for example, qubits A and B could be in a superposition of states like $\\alpha_0|00\\rangle+\\alpha_1|11\\rangle.$ The state of A or B could be undetermined by nature, and yet A and B could still be guaranteed to be in the same state.\n",
    "- Through a combination of entanglements and measurements, we can transfer a state (which can store information) from one qubit to another. This transfer can even be done over long distances, and this is called quantum teleportation.\n",
    "- Quantum teleportation relies on quantum measurements, which are probabilistic. Thus, classical communication can be necessary to tweak the teleported states. This prevents quantum teleportation from moving information faster than light. Quantum teleportation does not violate relativity or causality.\n",
    "- Modern quantum computers are more susceptible to noise and errors than classical computers. Expect a few percent error.\n",
    "- The more gates you add in sequence (especially 2-qubit gates) the more errors and noise you can expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### True/False questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T/F Quantum teleportation can be used to send information faster than light.\n",
    "2. T/F Modern evidence suggests that the collapse of a quantum state propagates faster than light.\n",
    "3. T/F In Qiskit, qubits are ordered in states with the lowest-numbered qubit on the right, as in $|q_3,q_2,q_1, q_0\\rangle$\n",

    "### MC questions\n",

    "1. Qubits A and B are entangled, then separated by a great distance $d$. Qubit A is measured. Which statement is correct about the speed at which the state of qubit B is affected?\n",
    "\n",
    "- a. Qubit B is affected instantly, within experimental tolerance, in experiments run so far.\n",
    "- b. Qubit B is affected after a time $d/c$, meaning the quantum state \"collapses\" at approximately the speed of light, within experimental tolerance.\n",
    "- c. Qubit B is affected only after classical communication has occurred, meaning it happens in a time longer than $d/c$.\n",
    "- d. None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recall that measurement probability is related to amplitudes in quantum states. For example, if a qubit is initially in the state $\\alpha_0|0\\rangle+\\alpha_1 |1\\rangle,$ the probability of measuring the state $|0\\rangle$ is $|\\alpha_0|^2.$ Not all sets of measurements will exactly match these probabilities, due to finite sampling (just as flipping a coin might yield heads twice in a row).
