    "A Fourier transform is a ubiquitous tool with applications in math, physics, signal processing, data compression, and countless other fields. A *quantum* version of the Fourier transform, aptly named the quantum Fourier transform, forms the basis for some of the most important quantum algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, after a reminder of the classical Fourier transform, we'll talk about how we implement the quantum Fourier transform on a quantum computer. Then, we'll discuss one of the applications of the quantum Fourier transform to an algorithm called the phase estimation algorithm. Quantum phase estimation is a subroutine in Shor's famous factoring algorithm, which is sometimes referred to as the \"crown jewel\" of quantum computing. This module builds toward another module all about Shor's algorithm, but it's also meant to be stand-alone. The quantum Fourier transform is a fascinating and useful algorithm in its own right!"

    "## The classical Fourier transform\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into the quantum Fourier transform, let's first remind ourselves of the classical version. The Fourier transform is a method of transforming from one so-called \"basis\" to another. You can think of two bases as different perspectives of the same problem — they are both valid ways to express a function, but one or the other might be more illuminating, depending on the problem at hand. Some examples of pairs of bases that are connected by Fourier transform are position and momentum, and time and frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of how the Fourier transform might help us figure out what note an instrument is playing based on its audio waveform. Typically, we see the waveforms represented in the time basis — that is, the amplitude of the wave is expressed as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Single sinusoidal signal plotted as a function of time.](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/qft/Cnote.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can Fourier transform this waveform to go from the time basis to the frequency basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Frequency spectrum of the audio waveform. one clear sharp peak at 260 Hz.](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/qft/Cnotefreq.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the frequency basis, we can easily see a clear peak at about 260 Hz. That's a middle C!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you might have been able to do determine that a middle C was being played without the use of a Fourier transform, but what if multiple notes are played at once? Then the waveform becomes more complicated when we plot it in the time basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Displacement vs. time graph of multiple sine waves at once, creating a more complicated periodic pattern.](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/qft/Cchord.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "But the frequency spectrum clearly identifies three peaks:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Frequency spectrum of the above audio waveform. Three peaks at approximately 260 Hz, 330 Hz, and 392 Hz. The last peak is very weak, but visible.](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/qft/Cchordfreq.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a C-major chord, playing the notes C, E, and G.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of Fourier analysis can help us extract the frequency components of any sort of complicated signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Fourier transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier transform is useful for any number of signal-processing applications. But in most of these real-world applications (including the music example we used above), we want to transform a discrete set of $N$ data points — not a continuous function. In this case, we use the *discrete* Fourier transform. The discrete Fourier transform acts on a vector $(x_0, ..., x_{N-1})$ and maps it to the vector $(y_0, ..., y_{N-1})$ according to the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}x_j\\omega_N^{jk}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we take $\\omega_N^{jk} = e^{2\\pi i \\frac{jk}{N}}$. (Note that there are other conventions that have a minus sign in the exponential, so be careful when you see the DFT in the wild.) Recall that $e^{2\\pi i \\frac{jk}{N}}$ is a periodic function, with period $\\frac{N}{k}$. So, by multiplying by this function, the Fourier transform is essentially a way to break the (discrete) function $\\{x_{j}\\}$ into a linear combination of its constituent periodic functions, each with period $\\frac{N}{k}$."

    "## The quantum Fourier transform\n",
    "\n",
    "So now, we've seen how the Fourier transform is used to represent a function as a linear combination of a new set of so-called \"basis functions.\" Basis transformations are regularly done on qubit states, too. For example, the state of a single qubit $|\\psi\\rangle$ can be expressed in the computational basis $|\\psi\\rangle = c_0 |0\\rangle + c_1 |1\\rangle$, with basis states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, or in the $X$ basis $|\\psi\\rangle = c_+ |+\\rangle + c_- |-\\rangle$ with basis states $|+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$ and $|-\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle)$. Both are equally valid, but one might be more natural than the other, depending on the type of problem you are trying to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubit states can also be expressed in the Fourier basis where a state is expressed in terms of a linear combination of the Fourier basis states $|\\phi_y\\rangle$, rather than the usual, computational basis states, $|x\\rangle$. To do this, you need to apply a quantum Fourier transform (QFT):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ | \\phi_y \\rangle =  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{x=0}^{N-1}\\omega_N^{y x} \\vert x \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\omega_N^{yx} = e^{\\frac{2\\pi y x}{N}}$ as above, and $N$ is the number of basis states in your quantum system. Note that, since we're working with qubits now, $m$ qubits gives you $2^m$ basis states, so $N=2^m$. Here, the basis states are written as just a single number $|x\\rangle$ where $x$ ranges from $0$ to $N-1$, but you might more typically see the basis states expressed as $|00...00\\rangle$, $|00...01\\rangle$, $|00...11\\rangle$, ..., $|11...11\\rangle$, where each binary digit represents the state of qubit 0 through $m-1$, from right to left. There's an easy way to convert these binary states to a single number: just treat them like binary numbers! So, $|00...00\\rangle = |0\\rangle$, $|00...01\\rangle = |1\\rangle$, $|00...10\\rangle = |2\\rangle$, $|00...11\\rangle = |3\\rangle$, and so on, all the way up to  $|11...11\\rangle = |2^m -1\\rangle = |N-1\\rangle$."

All of the Fourier basis states are equal superpositions of all the computational basis states, but each state differs from the other in the periodicity in the components' *phase*.

    "As you can see, we measure the populations of each state to be more or less equal, give or take some experimental and statistical noise. So, if you take the QFT of a single computational basis state, the result is an equal superposition of all states. If you're familiar with Fourier transforms, this probably doesn't surprise you. One basic principle that can help us build an intuitive connection between a function and its Fourier transform is that the width of a function is inversely proportional to the width of its Fourier transform. So, something that is very localized in time, for example, like a very short pulse, will require a broad range of frequencies to generate that pulse. So that signal will be very broad in Fourier space.\n",

So if th uncertainty in $x$ ($\\Delta x$) is small, the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) must be big, and vice-versa. It turns out that transforming from the position basis $x$ to the momentum basis $p$ is accomplished through a Fourier transform.\n",

    "So, hopefully from the first four QFTs you can start to see how each one is nested inside the next largest one. You may have noticed, though, that some of the phase gates are not exactly as prescribed in the procedure we outlined above, and the SWAPs don't appear after each subroutine, but are rather only at the very end of the full QFT. This is just to save us unnecessary gates, which would cause the circuit to take longer and be more error-prone. Instead of implementing the SWAP after each nested doll, instead, the circuit keeps track of where each qubit state *should* be and adjusts the qubits to which it's applying the phase gates accordingly. Then, a final set of SWAPs at the end puts everything in its proper place.\n",

    "## Application of the QFT: Phase Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how the QFT can be used to solve a useful problem in quantum computing. Calculating the inverse quantum Fourier transform is a necessary step in an algorithm known as Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), which is itself a subroutine in many other algorithms, including the \"crown jewel\" of quantum algorithms, Shor's factoring algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of QPE is to estimate the eigenvalues of a unitary operator. Unitary operators are ubiquitous in quantum computing, and often, finding the eigenvalues of their associated eigenvectors is a necessary step in a larger algorithm. Depending on the problem, an eigenvalue can represent an energy of a Hamiltonian in a simulation-type problem, can help us find prime factors of a number in Shor's algorithm, or can contain other essential information. QPE is one of the most important and widely used subroutines in quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what does this have to do with a quantum Fourier transform? Well, as you may recall, any eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of a unitary operator has a magnitude $|\\lambda| = 1$. So we can write each eigenvalue as a complex number with magnitude one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda = e^{2\\pi i \\theta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta$ is a real number between 0 and 1. If you would like more information on unitary matrices, see John Watrous' [lesson on the subject](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/multiple-systems/introduction) in Basics of Quantum Information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\lambda$ is *periodic* in $\\theta$. Already, this might suggest to you that a QFT could be involved, since we saw how useful QFTs are for analyzing periodic functions. Below, we'll walk through the algorithm and see precisely how the QFT comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How QPE works:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll start with the simplest QPE algorithm, which roughly estimates the phase to a single binary digit of precision. In other words, this algorithm can distinguish between $\\theta = 0 $ and $\\theta = 1/2$, but can't do better than that. Here's the circuit diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Circuit diagram of the QPE algorithm for a single data qubit. A Hadamard is applied to the data qubit. Next, the algorithm uses another helper qubit, on which a controlled-U gate is applied, with the data qubit as the control. After another Hadamard on qubit 0, the qubits are measured.](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/qft/QPE1qubit.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the qubits are prepared in the state $|\\pi_0\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle|0\\rangle$, where qubit $0$ is in the state $|0\\rangle$ and the remaining qubits are in the state $|\\psi\\rangle$, which is an eigenstate of $U$. After the first Hadamard, the qubit state becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\pi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|\\psi\\rangle (|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The next gate is a \"controlled-$U$\" gate. This applies the unitary operation $U$ to the bottom qubits that are in the state $|\\psi\\rangle$ if qubit 0 is in the state $|1\\rangle$, but does nothing to $|\\psi\\rangle$ if qubit 0 is in the state $|0\\rangle$. This transforms the qubits to the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\pi_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}( |\\psi\\rangle|0\\rangle + e^{2\\pi i \\theta}|\\psi\\rangle|1\\rangle)$\n",
    " $ =  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|\\psi\\rangle (|0\\rangle + e^{2\\pi i \\theta}|1\\rangle) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Something weird just happened: the controlled-$U$ gate only uses qubit $0$ as a control qubit, so one might think that this gate wouldn't change qubit 0's state at all. But somehow, it does! Even though the operation was applied to the lower qubits, the overall effect of the gate is to change the phase of qubit $0$. This is known as the \"phase kickback mechanism,\" and is used in many quantum algorithms, including Deutsch-Josza and Grover's algorithms. If you want to learn more about the phase-kickback mechanism, see John Watrous' lesson on [Quantum query algorithms](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/quantum-query-algorithms/deutsch-algorithm) in Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the phase-kickback, we apply one more Hadamard to qubit $0$, which results in the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\pi_3\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle ( \\frac{1+e^{2\\pi i \\theta}}{2} |0\\rangle + \\frac{1 - e^{2\\pi i \\theta}}{2}|1\\rangle) = |\\psi\\rangle ( \\cos(\\pi\\theta) |0\\rangle - i \\sin(\\pi\\theta)|1\\rangle)$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, when we measure qubit $0$ at the end, we will measure $|0\\rangle$ with 100% certainty if $\\theta = 0$ and we will measure $|1\\rangle$ with 100% certainty if $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}$ (and if our quantum computer is perfect, with no noise). If $\\theta$ is something other than this, the final measurement is only probabilistic and only tells us so much.\n",
    "\n",
    "### QPE with more precision: more qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "We can extend this simple concept to a more complicated algorithm with arbitrary precision. If instead of just using qubit $0$ to measure the phase, we use $m$ qubits $0$ through $m-1$, then we will be able to estimate the phase with $m$ bits of precision. Let's see how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Circuit diagram of the QPE algorithm for a multiple qubits. Hadamards are applied to the data qubits 0 through m-1. Then a series of controlled-U gates are applied to the m helper qubits. Finally, an inverse QFT is applied to the qubits and they are measured.](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/qft/QPE_withpi.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This more precise QPE circuit starts out the same as the single bit version: Hadamards are applied to the first $m$ qubits, and the remaining qubits are prepared in the state $|\\psi\\rangle$, creating the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\pi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2^{m/2}}|\\psi\\rangle(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)...(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the controlled-unitaries are applied. Qubit $0$ is the control for the same unitary $U$ as before. But now, qubit $1$ is the control for the unitary $U^2$, which is just $U$ applied twice. So, the eigenvalue of $U^2$ is $e^{2*2\\pi i \\theta}$. In general each qubit $k$ from 0 through $m-1$ will be the control for the unitary $U^{2^k}$. That means each of these qubits will experience a phase kickback of $e^{2^k*2\\pi i \\theta}$. This results in the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\pi_2\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes \\frac{1}{2^{m/2}} (|0\\rangle+e^{2^{m-1}2\\pi i \\theta}|1\\rangle)(|0\\rangle+e^{2^{m-2}2\\pi i \\theta}|1\\rangle)...(|0\\rangle+e^{2\\pi i \\theta}|1\\rangle)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be rewritten as a sum over the computational basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\pi_2\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes \\frac{1}{2^{m/2}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{m}-1} e^{2\\pi i k \\theta} |k\\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the sum look familiar? It's a QFT! Recall the equation for a quantum Fourier transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{QFT}_{2^m}| y \\rangle =  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^m}}\\sum_{x=0}^{2^m-1}\\omega_{2^m}^{y x} \\vert x \\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the phase $ \\theta = y/2^m $ for some integer $y$ between $0$ and $2^m-1$, then taking the inverse QFT of this state will result in the state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\pi_3\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |y\\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and from $|y\\rangle$, we can deduce $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\theta/2^m$ is *not* an integer multiple, however, then taking the inverse QFT will only *approximate* $\\theta$. How well it approximates $\\theta$ will be probabilistic, meaning we won't always get the best approximation, but it will be pretty close, and the more qubits $m$ you use, the better the approximation you will get. To learn about how to quantify this approximation of $\\theta$, check out John Watrous' lesson on [Phase estimation and factoring](/learning/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/phase-estimation-and-factoring/introduction) in Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithms.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully this module gave you a sense for what a QFT is, how it's implemented on a quantum computer, and how useful it can be in solving problems. We gave you a taste for its usefulness when we saw how it can be used in quantum phase estimation to learn about the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix."
