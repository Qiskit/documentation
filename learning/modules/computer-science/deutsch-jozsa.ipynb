    "## 1. Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1980's, quantum physicists and computer scientists had a vague notion that quantum mechanics could be harnessed to make computations that were far more powerful than classical computers can make. Their reasoning was this: it's difficult for a classical computer to simulate quantum systems, but a *quantum* computer should be able to do it more efficiently. And if a quantum computer could simulate quantum systems more efficiently, perhaps there were other tasks that it could perform more efficiently than a classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic was sound, but the details remained to be worked out. This began in 1985, when David Deutsch described the first \"universal quantum computer.\" In this same paper, he provided the first example problem for which a quantum computer could solve something more efficiently than a classical computer could. This first toy example is now known as \"Deutsch's algorithm.\" The improvement in Deutsch's algorithm was modest, but Deutsch worked with Richard Jozsa a few years later to further widen the gap between classical and quantum computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms — Deutsch's, and the Deutsch-Jozsa extension — are not particularly useful, but they are still really important for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Historically, they were some of the first quantum algorithms that were demonstrated to beat their classical counterparts. Understanding them can help us understand how the community's thinking on quantum computing has evolved over time.\n",
    "2. They can help us understand some aspects of the answer to a surprisingly subtle question: What gives quantum computing its power? Sometimes, quantum computers are compared to giant, exponentially-scaling parallel processors. But this isn't quite right. While a piece of the answer to this question lies in so-called \"quantum parallelism,\" extracting as much information as possible in a single run is a subtle art. The Deutsch and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms show how this can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll learn about Deutsch's algorithm, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and what they teach us about the power of quantum computing."

    "## 2. Quantum parallelism and its limits\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the power of quantum computing is derived from \"quantum parallelism.\" which is essentially the ability to perform operations on multiple inputs at the same time, since the qubit input states could be in a superposition of multiple classically allowed states. HOWEVER, while a quantum circuit might be able to evaluate multiple input states at once, extracting all of that information in one go is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what I mean here, let's say we have a bit, $x$ and some function applied to that bit, $f(x)$. There are four possible binary functions taking a single bit to another single bit:\n",
    "\n",
    "| $x$    |  $f_1(x)$ | $f_2(x)$ | $f_3(x)$ | $f_4(x)$ |\n",
    "| ----------- | ------- |-------| -------- | ------- |\n",
    "| 0  | 0   | 0  | 1   | 1 |\n",
    "| 1  | 0   | 1  | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like to find out which of these functions (1-4) our $f(x)$ is. Classically, we would need to run the function twice — once for $x=0$, once for $x=1$. But let's see if we can do better with a quantum circuit. We can learn about the function with the following gate:\n",
    "\n",
    "![quantum_parallelism](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa/quantum-parallelism.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the $U_f$ gate computes $f(x)$, where $x$ is the state of qubit 0, and applies that to qubit 1. So, the resulting state, $|x\\rangle|y\\oplus f(x)\\rangle$, simply becomes $|x\\rangle|f(x)\\rangle$ when $|y\\rangle = |0\\rangle$. This contains all the information we need to know the function $f(x)$: qubit 0 tells us what $x$ is, and qubit 1 tells us what $f(x)$ is. So, if we initialize $|x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)$, then the final state of both qubits will be: $|y\\rangle|x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|f(0)\\rangle|0\\rangle+|f(1)\\rangle|1\\rangle)$. But how do we access that information?\n",

    "### 2.1. Try it on Qiskit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Qiskit we'll randomly select one of the four possible functions above and run the circuit. Then your task is to use the measurements of the quantum circuit to learn the function in as few runs as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first experiment and throughout the module, we will use a framework for quantum computing known as \"Qiskit patterns\", which breaks workflows into the following steps:\n",

Then the two outputs of the function, $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ interfered to return 0 if they were either both 0 or both 1 (the function was constant), and returned 1 if they were different (the function was balanced).

    "## 4. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's algorithm was an important first step in demonstrating how a quantum computer might be more efficient than a classical computer, but it was only a modest improvement: it required just one query, compared to two in the classical case. In 1992, Deutsch and his colleague, Richard Jozsa, extended the original two-qubit algorithm to more qubits. The problem remained the same: determine whether a function is *balanced* or *constant*. But this time, the function goes from $n$ bits to a single bit. Either the function returns 0 and 1 an equal number of times (it's *balanced*) or the function returns always 1 or always 0 (it's *constant*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a circuit diagram of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "![DJ_algo.png](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/deutsch-jozsa/DJ_algo.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm works in the same way as Deutsch's algorithm: the phase-kickback allows one to read out the state of qubit 0 to determine whether the function is constant or balanced. It's a bit trickier to see than for the two-qubit Deutsch's algorithm case, since the states will include sums over the $n$ qubits, and so working out those states will be left as an optional exercise for you at the end of the module. The algorithm will return a bitstring of all 0's if the function is constant, and a bitstring containing at least one 1 if the function is balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how the algorithm works in Qiskit, first, we need to generate our oracle: the random function that is guaranteed to be either constant or balanced. The code below will generate a balanced function 50% of the time, and a constant function 50% of the time. Don't worry if you don't entirely follow the code — it's complicated and not necessary for our understanding of the quantum algorithm."

Here's the problem:\n",

But now, instead of promising that the function is balanced or constant, we're now promised that the function is the dot product between the input string $x$ and some secret $n$-bit string $s$, modulo 2. (This dot product modulo 2 is called the \"binary dot product.\") The problem is to figure out what the secret, $n$-bit string is.\n",

The point is, though, that the phase kickback mechanism leads to the input qubits being in the state $|s\\rangle$.

To make sense of this, think about Bernstein-Vazirani functions, which are of the form $f(x) = s \\cdot x$. Are these functions also Deutsch-Jozsa functions? That is, determine whether functions of this form satisfy the Deutsch-Jozsa problem promise: that they're either *constant* or *balanced*.

    "After they used the algorithm to solve their problem, Bernstein and Vazirani used this as the basis for a more complicated, recursive problem called the *recursive Fourier sampling problem*. Their solution offered a super-polynomial speedup over classical algorithms. And even before Bernstein and Vazirani, Peter Shor had already come up with his famous algorithm that enabled quantum computers to factor large numbers exponentially faster than any classical algorithm could. These results, collectively showed the exciting promise of future quantum computer, and spurred physicists and engineers to make this future a reality."
