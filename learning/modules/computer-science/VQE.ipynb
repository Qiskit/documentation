    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the development of the quantum mechanical model in the early 20th century, scientists have understood that electrons do not follow fixed paths around an atom's nucleus but rather exist in regions of probability called orbitals. These orbitals correspond to specific, discrete energy levels that electrons can occupy. Electrons naturally reside in the lowest available energy levels, known as the ground state. However, if an electron absorbs sufficient energy, it can jump to a higher energy level, entering an excited state. This excited state is temporary, and the electron will eventually return to a lower energy level, releasing the absorbed energy, often in the form of light. This fundamental process of energy absorption and emission is crucial to understanding how atoms interact and form bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "When atoms come together to form molecules, their atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals. The arrangement and energy levels of electrons within these molecular orbitals dictate the properties of the resulting molecule and the strength of the chemical bonds. For instance, in the formation of a hydrogen molecule ($H_2$) from two individual hydrogen atoms, the electron from each atom occupies atomic orbitals. As the atoms approach each other, these atomic orbitals overlap and combine to form new molecular orbitals—one with lower energy (a bonding orbital) and one with higher energy (an anti-bonding orbital). The two electrons, one from each hydrogen atom, will preferentially occupy the lower-energy bonding orbital, leading to the formation of a stable covalent bond that holds the $H_2$ molecule together. The energy difference between the separated atoms and the formed molecule, particularly the energy of the electrons in the molecular orbitals, determines the stability and properties of the bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will delve into this process of molecular formation, focusing specifically on the $H_2$ molecule. We will use a real quantum computer, combined with classical optimization techniques, to investigate the energy of this simple yet fundamental process. This experiment will provide a practical demonstration of how quantum computation can be applied to solve problems in computational chemistry, offering insights into the crucial role of electron energy."

    "## 2. VQE - A Variational Quantum Algorithm for Eigenvalue problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximation techniques for chemistry - Variational Principle and the basis set\n",
    "\n",
    "Erwin Schrödinger's contributions to quantum mechanics go beyond introducing a new electronic model; fundamentally, he established wave mechanics by developing the famous time-dependent Schrödinger equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "i\\hbar \\frac{d}{dt}|\\psi\\rangle = \\hat{H}|\\psi\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, which represents the total energy of the system, and $|\\psi\\rangle$ is the wave function that contains all the information about the system’s quantum state. (Note: $\\frac{d}{dt}$ is the total time derivative, and we do not explicitly include the energy eigenvalue $E$ here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in many practical applications—such as determining the allowed energy levels of atoms and molecules—we instead use the time-independent Schrödinger equation (energy eigenvalue equation), which is derived from the time-dependent form by assuming a stationary state. A stationary state is a quantum state in which the probability density of finding a particle at a given point in space does not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{H}|\\psi\\rangle = E|\\psi\\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this form, $E$ represents the energy eigenvalue corresponding to the quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$. The Hamiltonian includes various energy contributions, such as the kinetic energy of electrons and nuclei, the attractive forces between electrons and nuclei, and the repulsive forces between electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the energy eigenvalue equation allows us to calculate the quantized energy levels of atomic and molecular systems. However, for molecules, solving it exactly is extremely difficult because the wave function $\\Psi$, which describes the spatial distribution of electrons, is highly complex and high-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, scientists use approximation techniques to obtain practical and accurate solutions. In this work, we will focus on two key methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variational Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "This method approximates the wave function and adjusts it to get as close as possible to the target energy, usually the ground state energy of the system. The key idea behind the variational principle is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we guess a wave function $\\Psi_\\text{trial}$ (a \"trial function\"), the energy calculated from it will always be equal to or higher than the ground state energy ($E_0$) of the system.\n",
    "$$E_\\text{approx} = \\frac{\\langle \\Psi_\\text{trial}|\\hat{H}|\\Psi_\\text{trial}\\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi_\\text{trial}|\\Psi_\\text{trial}\\rangle} \\geq E_0$$\n",
    "- By adjusting parameters $\\theta$ in the trial function, $|\\Psi_\\text{trial}(\\theta)\\rangle$, we can get a better and better approximation of the ground state energy.\n",
    "- Its accuracy heavily depends on the choice of the trial wave function $\\Psi_\\text{trial}$. A poorly-chosen trial function may lead to an energy estimate that is far from accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Basis Set Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approximation method comes in the stage of constructing the wave function—the basis set approach. In quantum chemistry, solving the Schrödinger equation exactly for molecules is impossible. Instead, we approximate the complex, multi-electron wave function by building it up from simpler, predefined mathematical functions. A **basis set** is essentially a collection of these known mathematical functions, typically centered on the atoms in the molecule, that are used as building blocks to represent the shape and behavior of the electrons in the system. Think of it like trying to recreate a detailed sculpture using only a collection of standard LEGO bricks – the more types and sizes of bricks you have (the larger the basis set), the more accurately you can approximate the original shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "These basis functions are often inspired by the analytical solutions for simple systems like the hydrogen atom, taking forms like Gaussian or Slater-type functions, though they are still approximations. Instead of working with the theoretically \"exact\" but intractable full molecular orbitals, we express them as a linear combination (a sum with coefficients) of these basis functions. This method is known as the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) approach when the basis functions resemble atomic orbitals. By optimizing the coefficients in this linear combination, we can find the best possible approximate wave function and energy within the limitations of the chosen basis set.\n",
    "- The more functions included in the basis set, the better the approximation, but this comes at the cost of higher computational effort.\n",
    "- A small basis set provides a rough estimate, while a large basis set gives more precise results at the expense of requiring significantly more computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, to make calculations feasible and reduce computational cost, we use the variational principle by approximating the wave function, which reduces the computational complexity and allows for iterative optimization to minimize energy. Meanwhile, the basis set approach simplifies calculations by representing atomic orbitals as a combination of predefined functions, rather than solving for a continuous wave function directly.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (Quantum) Observable: The Molecular Hamiltonian (Energy of a Molecule)\n",
    "\n",
    "In VQE, the molecular/atomic Hamiltonian is an observable, meaning we can measure its value through experiment. Our goal is to find the lowest possible energy (the ground state energy) of the molecule. To do this, we use a trial quantum state, generated by a parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz). We measure the observable and optimize the quantum state until we reach the lowest possible energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis set used for the molecular Hamiltonian determines the number of qubits required and directly affects the accuracy of VQE. Choosing the right basis set is crucial for balancing efficiency and precision. To simplify calculations without changing the basis set, we can use strategies like imposing __symmetry__ and __active space reduction__. Many molecules have symmetrical shapes (like a butterfly or snowflake), meaning some parts behave the same way. Instead of calculating everything separately, we can focus only on unique parts, saving quantum resources, thus leveraging symmetry. In active space reduction, we consider only the important orbitals, as not all electrons significantly impact molecular energy. Electrons close to the nucleus remain mostly unchanged, while others influence bonding. By applying these methods, we can make VQE more efficient while maintaining accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we obtain a molecular Hamiltonian using the proper basis set and strategies above, we need to transform this Hamiltonian into one suitable for quantum computers. Mapping problems to Pauli operators can be quite complicated. This is especially true in quantum chemistry, which works with indistinguishable particles (electrons), since qubits are distinguishable. We will not go into the details of the mappings here, but we refer you to the following resources. A general discussion of mapping a problem to quantum operators can be found in [Quantum Computing in Practice](/learning/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/index). A more detailed discussion on mapping chemistry problems into quantum operators can be found in [Quantum Chemistry with VQE](/learning/courses/quantum-chem-with-vqe/index).\n",

    "For this module, we will provide you with the appropriate (one-qubit) Hamiltonians for $H$ and $H_2$ so we can focus on using the quantum computer. These one-qubit Hamiltonians are prepared by using the so-called [STO-6g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STO-nG_basis_sets) basis set and used [Jordan-Wigner mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan%E2%80%93Wigner_transformation), which is the most straightforward mapping with the simplest physical interpretation, because it maps the occupation of one spin-orbital to the occupation of one qubit. Also, we used [qubit reduction technique by using a symmetry of the Hamiltonian](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08213), which uses the patterns in how spin occupations behave to reduce the number of qubits. For the $H_2$ molecule, we assume the distance between the two hydrogen atoms is `0.735` $\\mathring A$.\n",

    "#### (Quantum) Ansatz: The Trial Wave Function (How to build a trivial quantum state with a Quantum Circuit)\n",
    "\n",
    "For VQE, the ansatz consists of two key components. The first is __initial state preparation__, which sets up the qubit's state by applying quantum gates with no variational parameter. The second component is the __parameterized quantum circuit__, a special quantum circuit with adjustable parameters, similar to dials on a radio. These parameters will be used for the last part — the classical optimizer — to help us reach the best possible ground state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the variational principle section, we learned that the quality of the trial state affects the quality of the results of the variational algorithm. This means that choosing a good ansatz is important in VQE. Once again, this is a rich and complex topic. We will not cover the different types of ansatz or their origins here. If you're interested in learning more about parameterized quantum circuits and ansatz, you can explore the following resources: [Ansatz and variational form](/learning/courses/variational-algorithm-design/ansaetze-and-variational-forms) of [Variational algorithm design course](/learning/courses/variational-algorithm-design/index), which provides detailed explanations and examples of ansatz.\n",

    "#### (Classical) Optimizer: Fine-Tuning the Quantum Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the quantum computer measures the energy of the observable from the ansatz, the parameters of the ansatz and the energy value are sent to the classical optimizer for tuning. This optimization process is performed on a classical computer, typically using general-purpose scientific packages like SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical optimizer treats the measured energy as a cost function. In optimization problems, a cost function (also sometimes called an objective function) is a mathematical function that measures how \"good\" a particular solution is. The goal of the optimizer is to find the set of parameters that minimizes this cost function. In the context of finding the ground state energy of a molecule, the energy itself serves as the cost function – we want to find the parameters for our quantum circuit (our \"solution\") that yield the lowest possible energy. The classical optimizer uses this measured energy value (the cost) and determines the next set of optimized parameters for the quantum ansatz. These updated parameters are then sent back to the quantum circuit, and the process is repeated iteratively. With each iteration, the classical optimizer adjusts the parameters to try and reduce the energy (minimize the cost function) until a predefined convergence criterion is met, ideally ensuring that the lowest possible energy (corresponding to the ground state of the molecule for that bond distance and basis set) is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many optimization strategies provided by scientific packages like SciPy. You can find more in the [Optimization Loops](/learning/courses/variational-algorithm-design/optimization-loops) lesson of the [Variational Algorithm Design](/learning/courses/variational-algorithm-design/index) course. Here we will use COBYLA (Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximations), an optimization algorithm suitable for complicated energy landscapes. In particular, COBYLA does not attempt to calculate a gradient of the function being studied; this is called a gradient-free optimizer. Imagine you are trying to find the highest peak in a mountain range with your eyes closed. Since you can’t see the whole landscape, you take small steps in different directions, while checking if you’re going up or down. COBYLA works in a similar way — it moves through the parameter space, testing different values, gradually improving the result until it finds the best one.\n",

This Hamiltonian represents the total energy of the system in terms of qubit operators, having been produced and mapped from the molecular system using a standard procedure: 1) employing the **STO-6G basis set** (a specific collection of mathematical functions used to approximate the electron orbitals), 2) applying the **Jordan-Wigner mapping** (a technique to translate fermionic operators describing electrons into qubit operators), and 3) performing **qubit reduction** using symmetries of the Hamiltonian to simplify the problem.\n",

    "Next, we need a parameterized quantum circuit, called an ansatz, to prepare a trial wavefunction $\\Psi_\\text{trial}$ for the ground state. The goal is to find the parameters $\\theta$ that minimize the energy expectation value $\\langle\\psi(\\theta)|\\hat{H}|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle$. The choice of ansatz is crucial because it determines the set of possible quantum states that our circuit can prepare. A \"good\" ansatz is one that is flexible enough to represent a state very close to the true ground state of the Hamiltonian we are studying, but not so complex that it requires too many parameters or too deep a circuit for current quantum computers.\n",

    "2.  **2-axis rotational gates ansatz:** This ansatz combines rotations around two different axes ($R_x(\\theta_1) R_z(\\theta_2)$ and $R_x(\\theta_1) R_z(\\theta_2) R_x(\\theta_3)$). This allows us to reach a larger portion of the Bloch sphere compared to a single-axis rotation.\n",

You can think of these parameters like rotations around different axes on a spherical surface. To see the distribution of quantum state, we will use [the Bloch Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere), a 3D sphere that shows the state of a single qubit. Any point on the sphere represents a possible state of the qubit, where the north and south poles are like the classical \"0\" and \"1\", but the qubit can also be anywhere in between, showing special quantum properties like superposition.

    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize what we've learned so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first looked at two important approximation techniques needed to solve quantum chemistry problems: the variational principle and basis set choices, which are both fundamental to VQE. We explored the variational principle by hand, calculating the ground state energy of the simple harmonic oscillator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we dove into VQE, a widely used algorithm for calculating the ground state energy of a quantum system. We ran code to calculate the ground state energies for atomic Hydrogen ($H$) and the Hydrogen molecule ($H_2$). In particular, we learned that it is necessary to obtain the appropriate molecular Hamiltonian for the system and to transform it into a form executable on a quantum computer. We also saw that the ansatz, a parameterized quantum circuit, is needed to prepare trial quantum states within VQE, and we discussed the importance of choosing an appropriate ansatz circuit structure. We also learned that VQE relies on an iterative optimization process using a classical computer, guiding the quantum circuit to find the lowest energy state, and saw how the convergence of this process is monitored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we used the computed ground state energies of $H$ and $H_2$ obtained via VQE to calculate the reaction energy for the process $H + H \\rightarrow H_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "VQE is a powerful near-term quantum algorithm, but it's important to be aware of its limitations. The performance of VQE heavily depends on the choice of the ansatz – finding an efficiently preparable ansatz that can accurately represent the true ground state becomes increasingly challenging for larger, more complex molecules. Furthermore, current quantum hardware is susceptible to noise, which can impact the accuracy of VQE results, particularly for deeper circuits or larger numbers of qubits. Despite these challenges, VQE serves as a foundational algorithm, and ongoing research is exploring more sophisticated variational methods and error mitigation techniques to push the boundaries of what is possible in quantum chemistry on near-term quantum computers. For instance, algorithms like Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) are being developed, which leverage samples obtained from quantum circuits combined with classical diagonalization in a subspace to improve energy estimation and address some of the limitations faced by VQE, particularly regarding measurement efficiency and noise robustness."

    "## 7. Review and questions\n",

    "\n",
    "- Variational Quantum Algorithm is a computing paradigm in which a classical computer and a quantum computer work together to solve a problem.\n",
    "- In VQE, we start with a Hamiltonian of our system and map it onto qubits for execution on the quantum computer. We select a parameterized quantum circuit, an ansatz, and make repeated measurements, varying the parameters of the ansatz, until the lowest energy value is reached. The search through parameter space is done using a classical optimizer. To achieve good results, it is necessary to select a good ansatz and an appropriate optimizer.\n",
    "- Reaction energy is the total energy change in a chemical reaction, determined by the difference between the energy of the reactants and the products.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### True/false\n",
    "1. The variational principle states that the expectation value of the energy for any trial wavefunction is always greater than or equal to the true ground state energy.\n",
    "2. A basis set is a collection of functions used to approximate quantum wavefunctions.\n",
    "3. VQE is a quantum algorithm used to exactly solve the Schrödinger equation for a given Hamiltonian.\n",

    "- C) To reduce circuit complexity\n",
    "- D) To measure eigenvalues directly\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Which of the following is the most correct statement about choosing a good ansatz?\n",
    "- A) An ansatz must produce states evenly distributed over the Bloch sphere, or it will fail.\n",
    "- B) An ansatz should be tailored to your system to make sure it can generate states close to the ground state.\n",
    "- C) An ansatz should produce random states using its variational parameters.\n",

    "## (Optional) Appendix: Optimizer overhead by ansatz complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "VQE faces several well-known challenges[ref 6], and the following are related to what we have learned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ansatz Selection Challenges\n",
    "There is an inherent challenge in selecting the right variational ansatz. Chemistry-inspired ansätze (like UCCSD) provide physical accuracy but require deep circuits, while hardware-efficient ansätze have shallower circuits but may lack physical interpretability. Also, many ansätze introduce excessive variational parameters that contribute little to improving accuracy but significantly increase optimization difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optimization Difficulties\n",
    "The optimization landscape of VQE can have regions where gradients vanish exponentially (barren plateaus), making it difficult for classical optimizers to update the variational parameters efficiently. For this, researchers have tried to use different types of optimizers - gradient-based and gradient-free, but both face challenges. Gradient-based optimizers suffer from barren plateaus, while gradient-free methods require a large number of function evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "One more well-known challenge is optimizer overhead, which is related to the scale of the problem. The quantum circuits required for VQE grow in depth and complexity as the problem size increases; this typically also increases the number of parameters to optimize. The optimization process becomes intractable as the number of parameters increases, leading to slow convergence and difficulties in finding the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will take a look at these challenges by using VQE for $H_2$ molecule, with a two different type of ansatz.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note: This can take more QPU time, so feel free to use a noisy simulator for this if you don't have enough time.)"
