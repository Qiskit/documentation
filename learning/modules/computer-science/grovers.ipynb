    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grover's algorithm** is a foundational quantum algorithm that addresses the *unstructured search problem*: given a set of $N$ items and a way to check if any given item is the one you're looking for, how quickly can you find the desired item? In classical computing, if the data is unsorted and there is no structure to exploit, the best approach is to check each item one by one, leading to a query complexity of $O(N)$ — on average, you'll need to check about half the items before finding the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![A diagram of classical unstructured search.](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/grovers/classical-uss.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's algorithm, introduced by Lov Grover in 1996, demonstrates how a quantum computer can solve this problem much more efficiently, requiring only $O(\\sqrt{N})$ steps to find the marked item with high probability. This represents a *quadratic speedup* over classical methods, which is significant for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm operates in the following context:\n",
    "- **Problem setup:** You have a function $f(x)$ that returns 1 if $x$ is the item you want, and 0 otherwise. This function is often called an *oracle* or *black box*, since you can only learn about the data by querying $f(x)$.\n",
    "- **Usefulness of quantum:** While classical algorithms for this problem require, on average, $N/2$ queries, Grover's algorithm can find the solution in roughly $\\pi\\sqrt{N}/4$ queries, which is much faster for large $N$.\n",
    "- **How it works (at a high level):**\n",
    "  - The quantum computer first creates a *superposition* of all possible states, representing all possible items at once.\n",
    "  - It then repeatedly applies a sequence of quantum operations (the Grover iteration) that amplifies the probability of the correct answer and diminishes the others.\n",
    "  - After enough iterations, measuring the quantum state yields the correct answer with high probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a very basic diagram of Grover's algorithm that skips over a lot of nuance. For a more detailed diagram, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04543).\n",

    "![A high-level diagram of the steps in implementing Grover's algorithm.](/learning/images/modules/computer-science/grovers/quantum-uss2.avif)\n",

    "A few things to note about Grover's algorithm:\n",
    "- It is optimal for unstructured search: no quantum algorithm can solve the problem with fewer than $O(\\sqrt{N})$ queries.\n",
    "- It provides only a quadratic, not exponential, speedup — unlike some other quantum algorithms (for example, Shor's algorithm for factoring).\n",
    "- It has practical implications, such as potentially speeding up brute-force attacks on cryptographic systems, though the speedup is not enough to break most modern encryption by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "For undergraduate students familiar with basic computing concepts and query models, Grover's algorithm offers a clear illustration of how quantum computing can outperform classical approaches for certain problems, even when the improvement is \"only\" quadratic. It also serves as a gateway to understanding more advanced quantum algorithms and the broader potential of quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amplitude amplification is a general purpose quantum algorithm, or subroutine, that can be used to obtain a quadratic speedup over a handful of classical algorithms. [Grover’s algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605043) was the first to demonstrate this speedup on unstructured search problems. Formulating a Grover's search problem requires an oracle function that marks one or more computational basis states as the states we are interested in finding, and an amplification circuit that increases the amplitude of marked states, consequently suppressing the remaining states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate how to construct Grover oracles and use the `GroverOperator` from the Qiskit circuit library to easily set up a Grover's search instance. The runtime `Sampler` primitive allows seamless execution of Grover circuits."

    "## Obvious caveat\n",

    "In order to apply Grover's algorithm, we had to build the Grover operator, which means we must be able to flip the phase on states that satisfy our solution criteria. This begs the question: if we know our solution set so well that we can design a quantum circuit to label each one, what are we searching for?! The answer is three-fold, and we will revisit this throughout the tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) These kinds of query algorithms often involve two parties**: one who has the oracle that establishes the solution criteria, and another who is trying to guess/find a solution state. The fact that one person can build the oracle does not negate the need for search.\n",

    "**(2) There are problems for which it is easier to specify a solution criterion than it is to find the solution.** The best-known example of this is probably identifying prime factors of large numbers. Grover's algorithm is not particularly effective at solving that specific problem; we would use Shor's algorithm for prime factoring. This is just an example to point out that knowing the criterion on the behavior of a state is not always the same as knowing the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Grover's algorithm does not only return classical data.** True, if we make a measurement of the final state after $t$ repetitions of the Grover operator, we are likely to obtain classical information identifying the solution state. But what if we don't want classical information; what if we want a solution state prepared on a quantum computer for further use in another algorithm? Grover's algorithm actually produces a quantum state with the solutions heavily weighted. So you may expect to find Grover's algorithm as a subroutine in more complicated quantum algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these in mind, let us work through several examples. We'll begin with an example in which the solution state is clearly specified so we can follow the logic of the algorithm, and we will move on to examples in which the usefulness of Grover's algorithm becomes more clear."

In order for charge to be conserved, the total number of `1`s must also stay constant.

    "- Grover's algorithm can be run with fewer than $t$ iterations and still amplify the target states.\n",
