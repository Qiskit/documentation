    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1990s, there was growing excitement around the potential of quantum computers to solve problems that were hard for classical computers. A few talented computer scientists had devised algorithms that demonstrated the power of quantum computing for some niche, contrived problems, but nobody had found a single, \"killer app\" of quantum computing that was sure to revolutionize the field. That was, until 1994, when Peter Shor came up with what is now called Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was well known at the time that finding the prime factors of a large number was extremely difficult for a classical computer. In fact, internet security protocols relied on this difficulty. Shor found a way to find these factors exponentially more efficiently by offloading some of the more challenging steps onto a theoretical, future quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will explore Shor's algorithm. First, we'll give a bit more context to the algorithm, formalizing the problem it solves and explaining the relevance to cyber security. Next, we'll give a primer on modular mathematics and how to apply it to the factoring problem, showing how factoring reduces to another problem called \"order-finding.\" We'll show how the Quantum Fourier Transform and Quantum Phase Estimation that we learned about in a previous module come into play, and how to use them to solve the order-finding problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll run Shor's algorithm on a real quantum computer! Keep in mind, though, that this algorithm will really only be useful when we have a large, fault-tolerant quantum computer, which is still some years away. So, we'll just factor a small number to demonstrate how the algorithm works."

    "## The factoring problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the factoring problem is to find the prime factors of a number $N$. For some numbers $N$, this is pretty easy. For example, if $N$ is even, one of its prime factors will be 2. If $N$ is a prime power, meaning $N=p^k$ for some prime number $p$, it is also fairly easy to find $p$: we just approximate the $k^{\\text{th}}$ root of $N$ and look for nearby primes that could be $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where classical computers struggle, though, is when $N$ is odd and *not* a prime power. This is the case Shor's algorithm deals with. The algorithm finds two factors $p$ and $q$ such that $N=pq$. It can be applied recursively until all factors are prime. In the next sections we'll see how this problem is tackled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevance to cyber security\n",
    "\n",
    "Many cryptographic schemes have been built based on the fact that factoring large numbers is hard, including one that is commonly used today, called RSA. In RSA, a public key is created by multiplying two large prime numbers together to get $N = p\\cdot q$. Then, anyone can use this public key to encrypt data. But only somebody with the private key, $p$ and $q$, can decrypt that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $N$ were easy to factor, then anyone would be able to determine what $p$ and $q$ are and break the encryption. But it's not. This is a famously difficult problem. In fact, the prime factors of a number called RSA1024, which is 1024 binary digits and 309 decimal digits long, has still not been found, despite a \\$100,000 prize being offered for its factoring way back in 1991."

    "In 1994, Peter Shor realized that a quantum computer could factor a large number exponentially more efficiently than a classical computer could. His insight relied on the relationship between this factoring problem and *modular arithmetic*. We'll go through a brief primer on modular arithmetic, then we'll see how we can use this to factor $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modular arithmetic\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular arithmetic is a system of counting that is cyclic, meaning that while counting starts in the usual way, with integers 0, 1, 2, etc., at some point, after a period $N$, the counting starts over again. Let's see how this works with an example. Say our period is 5. Then, as we're counting, where we would normally hit 5, we instead start over at 0:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, ...$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because in the \"modulo-5\" world, 5 is equivalent to 0. We say that $5\\bmod 5 \\ = 0$. In fact, all multiples of 5 will be equivalent to $0\\bmod 5$.\n",

    "#### $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_N^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often useful to introduce two sets, $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_N^*$. $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ is simply the set of numbers that exist in a \"modulo-$N$\" world. For example, when we were counting modulo-5, the set would be $\\mathbb{Z}_5=\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$. Another example: $\\mathbb{Z}_{15} = \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14\\}$. We can perform addition and multiplication (modulo $N$) on the elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the result of each of these operations also is an element in $\\mathbb{Z}_N$, making $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ a mathematical object called a *ring*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a special subset of $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ that is of particular interest to us for Shor's algorithm. That is the subset of numbers in $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ such that the greatest common divisor between each element and $N$ is 1, so each element is \"co-prime\" to $N$. If we take the set of these numbers along with the modular multiplication operation, then this forms another mathematical object, called a *group*. We call this group $\\mathbb{Z}_N^*$. Turns out that with $\\mathbb{Z}_N^*$ (and finite groups in general), if we pick any element $a \\in \\mathbb{Z}_N^*$, and repeatedly multiply $a$ to itself, we'll always eventually get the number $1$. The minimum number of times one must multiply $a$ to itself in order to get $1$ is called the **order** of $a$. This fact will be very important to our discussion of how to factor numbers below.\n",

For a detailed refresher, go to the QFT module or John Watrous' lesson on [Quantum Phase Estimation](/learning/courses/fundamentals-of-quantum-algorithms/phase-estimation-and-factoring/shor-algorithm) in his Quantum Algorithms course. We'll go through the gist of the procedure now:\n",

Then, we use QPE to approximate the corresponding eigenvalue, which, since the operator is unitary, will be of the form $e^{2\\pi i \\theta}$. So, finding the eigenvalue is equivalent to finding the value of $\\theta$ in the periodic function. The circuit looks like this:\n",

But hopefully you've also reached a new level of understanding of its deceptive simplicity. Although the algorithm may seem impressively (or intimidatingly) complex, if you break it down into each step of logic and go through it slowly, you, too, will be able to run Shor's algorithm.\n",

    "## Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modern cryptographic systems rely on the classical difficulty of factoring large integers.\n",
    "- Modular arithmetic — including the structures $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_N^*$ — provides the mathematical foundation for Shor’s algorithm.\n",
    "- The problem of factoring an integer $N$ can be reduced to the problem of finding the order of a number modulo $N$.\n",
    "- Quantum order finding uses quantum phase estimation techniques to determine the period of the function $a^x \\mod N$.\n",
    "- Shor’s algorithm consists of a classical–quantum hybrid workflow that selects a base, performs quantum order finding, and then classically computes the factors from the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### True/False:\n",
    "1. T/F The efficiency of Shor's algorithm threatens the security of RSA encryption.\n",
    "2. T/F Shor's algorithm can be executed efficiently on any modern-day quantum computer.\n",
    "3. T/F Shor’s algorithm uses quantum phase estimation (QPE) as a key subroutine.\n",
    "4. T/F The classical part of Shor’s algorithm involves calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD).\n",
    "5. T/F Shor’s algorithm only works for factoring even numbers.\n",
    "6. T/F A successful run of Shor’s algorithm always guarantees the correct factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short answer:\n",
    "1. Why is Shor’s algorithm considered a potential future threat to RSA encryption?\n",
    "2. Why is finding the period, or order, of a modular exponential function helpful for factoring a number in Shor’s algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge problems:\n",
    "1. How many control qubits $m$ do we need for a given number $N$ that we're trying to factor to obtain the precision in the QPE needed to find the correct value of the order $r$?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Following the procedure we outlined here to factor 15, now try to factor 21."
