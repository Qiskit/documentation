    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll explore one of the core principles at the heart of quantum theory: superposition. In our everyday experience, objects always have definite features. Their location, size, shape, color - everything about them - is determined and certain, even if we the observer haven’t yet measured them. In the quantum world, this isn’t necessarily the case. A quantum object can be in something called a “superposition” of multiple classically allowed states. When the superposition is measured, it will randomly “collapse” to one of those states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways, measuring a superposition state is like flipping a coin: there is no way to know ahead of time which way it will land. This fundamental indeterminism is and uncomfortable aspect of quantum mechanics that even Einstein had trouble with. He famously said, “God does not play dice” about this randomness. But, as we’ll see, God in fact does play dice - and flip coins.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re going to think about a classical coin flip as an analogy to the measurement of a superposition state. And - by playing with a \"quantum coin\" using Qiskit and a qubit on an IBM&reg; quantum processor - we'll quickly find the limits of that analogy."

While in *principle*, one could calculate which side the coin will land on if they knew the precise initial conditions of the coin and the force/torque of the flip, in *practice*, there is no way to know a priori which side the coin will land on. That's why we use the coin flip as a canonical example of a *classical probabilistic state*, where the outcome is essentially random. We can write the state of the coin before it lands to reflect this 50/50 probability:\n",

    "We can create a similar probabilistic state using a qubit on our quantum computer. Like the coin flip, a qubit also can be measured in two possible states: $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. We create the probabilistic, \"superposition\" state by starting in the state $|0\\rangle$, and then applying something called a Hadamard gate to the qubit. This puts it in an equal superposition of $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. Note that while this superposition state may look and behave like the coin at first blush, we will soon see that there is much more to it than that. The point of this module is to show you that a superposition is not the same as a classical coin flip.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Another (better) coin analogy using the $\\sqrt{\\text{NOT}}$ gate\n",
    "\n",
    "By now we've learned that the act of flipping a coin is pretty different from creating a superposition state. Is there a better analogy we could make to a coin that captures more of the superposition-like phenomena? Yes. Yes there is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to do another thought experiment with a coin. Imagine the coin sitting on the table, heads up. To make it heads down, we can simply flip it over. This is the computational equivalent of a \"NOT\" gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we want to construct an operation that, if applied twice, would be equivalent to the NOT gate. That is, we want a \"squareroot of NOT,\" or $\\sqrt{\\text{NOT}}$. We can do this by considering how the NOT gate is physically implemented on the coin: it's just a rotation of 180 degrees around, for example, the x-axis. So, if we were to rotate the coin just 90 degrees around the x-axis, it would be equivalent to a $\\sqrt{\\text{NOT}}$ gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that after applying the $\\sqrt{\\text{NOT}}$ gate, we want to ask whether the coin is heads up or heads down. It's neither - it's standing on its edge relative to the vertical axis. But now, let's redefine our \"measurement\" of the coin to be first, collapsing the coin along the measurement axis (by squashing it with your hand so that it's lying flat), and second, checking whether it's heads up or down.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we perform this \"measurement\" on the coin standing on its edge, then the coin will \"collapse\" to heads up and heads down with equal probability. Much like the coin flip, in principle, the direction that the coin falls can be predicted based on the initial conditions of the coin and how exactly the force of our hand is applied to the coin to \"collapse\" it. But in practice, it should be difficult to predict which side will land up, so it is essentially random.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can actually measure this coin along three different axes: $x$, $y$, and $z$. We see that the coin's edge is pointing along the $x$ and $z$, so measurement in those directions requires \"collapsing\" the coin - hence, along those axes, there will be random with 50:50 probability of measuring heads up and down. But along the $y$-axis, it's already flat, with its head facing the -y direction. We can call that \"heads forward.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while the x and z measurements yielded random results, the y measurement will alway yield the same result! If you recall the \"quantum coin flip\" experiment from the previous section, this is reminiscent to how the quantum coin behaved. It was measured to be 0 or 1  with 50/50 probability in the z-direction, but always $|+\\rangle$ and never $|-\\rangle$ along X.  **This is suggestive that perhaps a coin sitting still, on its edge, is a better way to visualize a superposition state of a qubit than coin wildly flipping through the air.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use Qiskit to see if our \"quantum coin\" behaves the same way as our classical coin when a $\\sqrt{\\text{NOT}}$ gate is applied. We'll apply $\\sqrt{\\text{NOT}}$ to a qubit starting in $|0\\rangle$, then use `Estimator` to check the expectation value of the three observables, X, Y, and Z."

In fact, there is a precise analogy between the coin and the qubit state now. We can visualize the qubit state as a vector pointing in the direction of heads on a coin, normal to the surface of the coin. So, heads up, or the $|0\\rangle$ state on a quantum coin, is equivalent to a vector pointing straight up; heads down, or $|1\\rangle$, is pointing straight down.

    "## Conclusion - so what *is* a superposition state?\n",
    "\n",
    "We started this module comparing the randomness of measuring a quantum superposition state to a coin flip. We likened the \"Hadamard gate\" that produces a quantum superposition to the act of flipping a coin. But, through a series of experiments, we learned that there are fundamental differences between a classical coin flip and a quantum superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned that there is actually nothing \"random\" about a qubit in a superposition state. It is like a coin sitting still in three-dimensional space. In fact, a coin that is free to rotate in 3 dimensions is a very close analogy to a particular way to visualize the quantum state of a qubit, called the Bloch vector. Quantum gates rotate this coin/Bloch vector deterministically and reversibly. It is only when we **measure** the qubit that any randomness is introduced. We compared this measurement process to squashing the coin so that it lies flat in the direction of the measurement axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether a quantum state is even in a superposition is really just in the eye of the beholder. As you've likely encountered before, we are free to choose our coordinate system - $x$, $y$, and $z$ can point along any three orthogonal directions. So, if we have a superposition of 0 and 1 in one coordinate system, we can define a new coordinate system - or equivalently, a new \"measurement basis\" - in which the state is pointing purely in the $+z$ direction, and therefore not in a superposition state. So, when we say a qubit is in a superposition, we must also answer the question, \"superposition of *what*?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You may leave this module with the impression that we've just removed all the mystery from quantum mechanics. After all, one of the supposedly \"weirdest\" aspects, the superposition state of a qubit, is really just as simple as a three-dimensional vector. But keep in mind that the coin is still only an analogy, and even the Bloch vector is only a visualization tool to calculate probabilities of measurement outcomes. We can’t say what a quantum state is *really* doing before it's measured. Because, checking that requires a measurement!\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- While the measurement of a qubit in a superposition is probabilistic, like flipping a coin, the superposition state itself behaves differently than a flipping coin.\n",
    "- A main difference between a classical probability distribution and a superposition is that the superposition has *phase* coherence, which allows it to interfere constructively or destructively.\n",
    "- The state of a single, isolated qubit can be visualized as a point on the so-called \"Bloch sphere,\" where the relative amplitudes of the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ components determine the polar angle $\\theta$ and the relative phases between the two components determine the azimuthal angle $\\phi$.\n",
    "- All single-qubit quantum gates can be viewed as rotations of the vector on this sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### T/F questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T/F A quantum superposition is basically the same as a probabilistic event in classical physics, like flipping a coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. T/F The length of the Bloch vector describing the state of a single isolated qubit is always 1.\n",

    "3. T/F Single-qubit quantum gates do not change the length of the Bloch vector.\n",
