# Overview

!["Hero image"](/learning/images/modules/quantum-mechanics/hero.avif)

This collection of Qiskit in classrooms modules is designed to fit into an undergraduate quantum mechanics course. The goal is to help educators and students leverage quantum computers to experimentally explore topics integral to a quantum mechanics course, such as uncertainty and superposition.
Each module should be started in class with some group and instructor support, but can be completed independently or in small groups. All activities can be completed in much less than the free time allotted as part of the Open Plan available to all users. Simulator options are also built in, just in case students accidentally exhaust their free quantum computing time.

Instructors can request versions of these notebooks with answer keys and guidance on placement in common curricula by filling out this [quick survey](https://ibm.biz/classrooms_instructor_key_request) on how the notebooks are being used.

## Recommended background

Each module contains recommendations on where in a curriculum each module might be most effective. Generally, students will get the most out of these modules if they have:

- Some linear algebra background ( $2 \times 2$ matrices should be sufficient)
- Some Python familiarity, though most notebooks can simply be run as written
