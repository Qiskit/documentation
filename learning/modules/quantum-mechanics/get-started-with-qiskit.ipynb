    "Two-qubit gates can resemble classical two-bit gates, but with one important caveat: all quantum gates must be reversible. In linear algebra terms, this means they are represented by unitary matrices. Thus, two input qubits always map to two output qubits, and the operation can, in principle, be undone. This stands in contrast to the classical gates we saw above such as AND or OR, which lose information and are irreversible — given an output, you cannot uniquely determine the input.\n",

The control qubit remains unchanged, but its state dictates what happens to the target qubit. If the control qubit is in the state $\\vert 1\\rangle$, then an $X$ gate is applied to that target; if the state of the control qubit is $\\vert 0\\rangle$, then no change is made. In the notation below, assume the qubit $A$ (rightmost qubit) is the control, and qubit $B$ (the leftmost qubit) is the target. Below, the notation used is $CNOT(q_{control},q_{target})\\vert BA\\rangle.$\n",

    "## Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements play a special role in quantum computing — one that has no classical computing analog. While in classical computing, you can check your bits at any point of your choosing during an algorithm, in quantum computing, you must be very selective about when to look at your qubits because measurement collapses their state and destroys the superposition that gives qubits their computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, given an $N$-bit quantum state $\\vert \\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^N-1} c_i \\vert i\\rangle$, a measurement will collapse the state to one of the basis functions $\\vert i\\rangle$ with a probability equal to $\\vert c_i\\vert ^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this destructive effect of a measurement isn't always a hindrance. It is in fact a key resource in certain algorithms and protocols, such as [quantum teleportation](/learning/modules/computer-science/quantum-teleportation) and [quantum key distribution](/learning/modules/computer-science/quantum-key-distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Qiskit, when a measurement is made, it is sent to a classical register where it is stored as a classical bit. Creating a circuit with a measurement looks like this:"

    "\n",
    "1. **Mapping** our problem to quantum circuits and operators\n",
    "2. **Optimizing** the circuit for target hardware\n",
    "3. **Executing** on target hardware\n",
    "4. **Post-processing** our results\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these steps, we will implement a *quantum* version of the half-adder circuit discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "The classical adder circuit uses an XOR and an AND gate to calculate the sum and carry bits, respectively. We can adapt these gates to the quantum context to make the quantum half adder. First, remembering that quantum gates are *reversible*, we cannot simply overwrite the inputs. Instead, we introduce two helper qubits initialized to $\\vert 0\\rangle$ to store the sum and carry outputs. So, our full quantum state will consist of qubits $A$ and $B$, and the sum and carry qubits, which we'll label $S$ and $C$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vert \\psi\\rangle = \\vert C S B A\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need quantum gates that accomplish what the XOR and AND gates did in the classical circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sum:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the XOR, we apply two CNOTs, each with control qubits $A$ and $B$ and target qubit $S$ for both. If $A$ and $B$ are different, then one of the CNOT gates will flip $S$ to the $\\vert 1\\rangle$ state. If $A$ and $B$ are both $\\vert 0\\rangle$, then nothing happens to $S$ and it remains in the $\\vert 0\\rangle$ state. If $A$ and $B$ are both $\\vert 1\\rangle$, then the state of $S$ will flip twice, bringing it back to the $\\vert 0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Carry:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the carry bit, we need something that works like the classical AND gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check your understanding\n",
    "Read the question(s) below, think about your answer, then click the triangle to reveal the solution.\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Look back through the gates we've discussed to see if you can guess which quantum gate we'll use in place of the classical AND gate:\n",
    "\n",
    "</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer:__\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the Toffoli gate! Remember, the Toffoli, or controlled-controlled-NOT gate, flips the target state if and only if control qubit 0 AND control qubit 1 are both $\\vert 1\\rangle$. So, if the target qubit starts in the state $\\vert 0\\rangle$, then it has the same action as the AND gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, now we have all the ingredients we need to make the quantum circuit:"

    "Above is the circuit diagram for the quantum half-adder circuit. As mentioned previously, the wires represent qubits $0$ to $3$ ordered from top to bottom, and the classical bit register is the bottom double-lined wire. Then, reading from left to right, we see how the gates are applied to each qubit by seeing where the boxes show up on the corresponding wires. Finally, the measurements are shown at the end. The measurements collapse the qubit states into definite $0$ or $1$ values, and the results are sent to a classical register.\n",
    "\n",
    "One subtlety: although the circuit diagram is drawn left to right, when writing the corresponding matrix expression we must read it right to left. This is because in matrix multiplication, the operator closest to the state vector acts first. So, for example, the above circuit (ignoring the measurements) would be written as: \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Optimizing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to optimize the circuit to be run on the quantum hardware. This optimization is accomplished through the transpiler, which translates the abstract circuit shown above into instructions that the quantum computer will understand. It assigns the logical qubits above to real, physical qubits on the processor and rewrites the gates in terms of its own native set of gates that have been optimized to run on the quantum computer. Finally, the transpiler also implements something called \"error suppression and mitigation\" to try to minimize the effect of errors on the result. This isn't so important for our very simple circuit, but if you continue in your quantum computing journey to run more complicated circuits, you will soon see the value of error suppression and mitigation. If you want to learn more about this, see Olivia Lane's course, [Quantum Computing in Practice](/learning/courses/quantum-computing-in-practice/introduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we load the packages that are required to communicate with IBM&reg; quantum computers and select a backend to run on. We can either choose the least-busy backend, or select a specific backend whose properties we know.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This module was designed to give you a firm foundational understanding of the basic principles behind quantum computing by comparing it to classical computing. We looked at the classical half-adder circuit and then showed you how to adapt the circuit to run with qubits on a quantum computer. Now you're ready to explore the other Qiskit in the Classroom modules!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast to classical bits which can only take on values 0 and 1, qubits can also be in **superposition** states of both 0 and 1.\n",
    "- Multiple qubits can be in a superposition over the classically allowed bitstrings called **computational basis states**.\n",
    "- Multiple qubits can be **entangled** so that the state of one depends on the state of the other.\n",
    "- The Qiskit convention is to use **little-endian notation**, which places the least significant qubit, $q_0$, in the rightmost position and the most significant qubit, $q_N$, leftmost.\n",
    "- **Quantum gates** are reversible operations that are represented by unitary matrices which act on the quantum state vectors. In this notation, the matrix closest to the vector (which is furthest right) acts first.\n",
    "- **Measurements** collapse a quantum superposition state into one of its classically allowed states, with probability equal to the square of the amplitude of the corresponding computational basis state in the superposition.\n",
    "- Quantum circuits are often represented using **quantum circuit diagrams**, where qubits are depicted as horizontal wires, and quantum gates appear along these wires from left to right.\n",
    "- To run a quantum circuit, we use the four steps in the **Qiskit patterns** workflow: **Map**, **Optimize**, **Execute**, **Post-process**."

    "### True/False Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A single bit in a classical computer can only hold the value 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Entanglement means the state of one qubit is independent of the state of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Quantum gates are generally irreversible operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Qiskit convention places the least significant qubit, $q_0$, at the leftmost position.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Measuring a quantum state always gives the exact same result if repeated many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The Hadamard gate creates superposition in a single qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Quantum circuits may include measurement operations that collapse the superposition state into one of the classically allowed states.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The number of possible classical states for $N$ bits is $2N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. The outcome probabilities for quantum measurements are given by the squared amplitudes of the classically measurable basis states.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short Answer Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What are some primary differences between a bit and a qubit?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What happens to a quantum state when it is measured?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why do we use little-endian notation in Qiskit?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are the four steps in the Qiskit patterns workflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the module, we only used the adder to add classically allowed states for $A$ and $B$. But we can also prepare $A$ and $B$ in superpositions! Change the code to prepare each qubit in an equal superposition of 0 and 1, then run the new circuit and obtain a new histogram. What do you see? Explain what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Toffoli gate decomposition. Use `decompose()` to show how the Toffoli gate is decomposed into single- and two-qubit gates, then verify this construction with matrix multiplication. Keep in mind that although circuit diagrams are read left to right, matrices are applied to quantum states right to left!"
