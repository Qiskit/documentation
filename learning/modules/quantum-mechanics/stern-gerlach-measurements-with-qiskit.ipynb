    "## The experiment\n",
    "In the early 1900's, evidence of quantized behavior on atomic scales was mounting. Many successful interpretations of data like Max Planck's explanation of the ultraviolet catastrophe, and experiments like the one by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach were critical in convincing the world that a system of quantum mechanics was necessary, and that certain physical phenomena are quantized. In the case of the Stern-Gerlach experiment (conceived by Stern in 1921 and carried out by Stern and Gerlach in 1922), the goal was to check for the quantization of angular momentum in atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around that same time a prevalent model for the atom was Bohr-Sommerfeld model, which was an extension to the Bohr model, and like the Bohr model, it predicted that electrons existing in certain quantized orbits similar to planets orbiting the sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Diagram of Bohr-Sommerfeld model. A central dot represents the nucleus of an atom. Circles or ellipses around that point represent atomic orbitals, looking very much like planetary orbits around the sun. Higher-energy orbits are farther from the nucleus.](/learning/images/modules/quantum-mechanics/stern-gerlach-measurements-with-qiskit/sg-orbitals.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ultimately this treatment would turn out to be insufficient to explain quantum mechanical behavior of the atom, broadly, it did predict many observed phenomenon, like the discrete spectral lines of atoms. The quantized orbits of electrons with specific energies corresponds to quantized values of angular momentum. It is this orbital angular momentum that Stern and Gerlach sought to observe in their experiment, though the experiment applies to any type of quantized angular momentum, including spin. You may often hear of the Stern-Gerlach experiment applied to spins. The focus of the original experiment was on orbital angular momentum simply because George Uhlenbeck and Samuel Goudsmit would not theorize the existence of spin until 1925.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the type of angular momentum, a charge with angular momentum has a magnetic moment. In the classical treatment of orbital motion, one would expect a particle of charge $q$, mass $m$ and angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ to have a magnetic moment $\\mu$ given by\n",

When combining different types of angular momentum, or generalizing to an arbitrary type, one often sees $\\vec{J}$ used instead of $\\vec{L}$, so we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{\\mu} = \\frac{gq}{2m}\\vec{J}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For classical objects $g=1$. For electrons, $g\\approx 2$, and there are many values for various nuclei and subatomic particles. The main point here is that quantized angular momentum means a quantized magnetic moment!\n",

    "Stern and Gerlach did not know about the $g$ factor, but even with it in the expression, we have a force equal to several known or measurable constants times an angular momentum. So using a magnetic field with a known gradient, and measuring the deflection of a particle as it passes through the field, we should get information about the angular momentum. This is the crux of the Stern-Gerlach experiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Neutral silver atoms were heated in an oven. As a beam of silver atoms streamed from the oven, beam collimators were used to select only atoms traveling near the center of the inhomogeneous magnetic field. Of course, some atoms deviate a bit to the left or right, and experience a weaker gradient in the field, or no gradient at all. So, we are not overly concerned with the behavior of atoms far to the left or right. We are interested in what happens to the atoms that travel down the center of the channel, where the magnetic field gradient will yield a force deflecting the atoms in the $z$-direction only.\n",

    "## What should we expect, classically?\n",
    "\n",
    "How would these atoms behave if they were exactly like bulky, classical magnets? You can do the experiment. Imagine firing tiny neodymium magnets past a large, powerful magnet. The orientation of the tiny magnets is random. But as they pass the large magnet, they quickly re-orient themselves to align with the field, and become attracted to the large magnet. The vast majority of tiny magnets are deflected toward the large magnet. The very astute observer might question, \"What about energy conservation?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, a magnetic moment in an external magnetic field has a potential energy associated with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U = -\\vec{\\mu}\\cdot \\vec{B} = -\\mu B \\cos(\\theta)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\\Delta U = U_f - U_i = -\\mu B (\\cos(0) - \\cos(\\pi)) = -2\\mu B.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So where does that energy go? A classical magnet like a small neodymium refrigerator magnet has many particles and can dissipate almost any quantity of energy as heat. The initial and final angles between the magnetic moment and the external magnetic field could be anything, and at least the initial orientation would be random. So a different amount of energy would be dissipated as heat for each tiny magnet. But classically this is no problem, since an ensemble of classical particles can dissipate any amount of energy as heat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What should we expect applying classical thinking to atomic scales?\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very least this is not the same for atomic-scale magnets, because there are fewer particles in play, fewer degrees of freedom through which energy may be dissipated. The proposals of early quantum mechanics suggested further that the energy that can be absorbed by an individual particle, such as the electron, would be quantized, meaning an electron could only absorb a few specific amounts of energy. Since the random initial orientations would require the dissipation of random amounts of energy, this should not be possible for a system with quantized energy levels. The excess energy could not be dissipated as heat. So what would happen instead?\n",

But what if that angular momentum vector could only point exactly along $z$ or exactly opposite $z$, but not have any other component along $z$?

But like the spin of an electron, IBM qubits are quantum mechanical systems that can interact with light and on which measurements can be made.

But what happens to the qubit's state (or the particle's angular momentum) after the measurement? To answer that, we'll need to define a circuit that allows us to make multiple measurements of the same qubits. Let us define a circuit that we can use to investigate this. We will want to allow for the possibility of measuring both states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, so we need something to rotate the qubit's initial state away from the default $|0\\rangle$ state. In this case, we will use a hadamard gate $H$, since $H|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)$. Note that, by default, both of these measurements will be along $z$."

IBM quantum computers, however, are designed to make measurements along only one axis ($z$). To measure a state along $x$ we must perform a \"change of basis\". This means we must perform an operation that takes states along $x$ in the Bloch sphere to $z$, and vice-versa.

We do not see cases where the projection switches from $+x$ to $-x$ or vice-versa. We can collect our observations and use them to develop further operators in matrix forms, and further state vectors.\n",

    "We can use these results to construct states with a definite, positive projection along $x$ (which we call $|+x\\rangle$), and those with definite, negative projection along $x$ (which we call $|-x\\rangle$). From those states, we can construct the matrix corresponding to $S_x$, exactly as we did for $S_z$. We leave these as exercises to the learner. Similarly, one can construct experiments making measurements along the $y$ axis, determine vectors for $|+y\\rangle$ and $|-y\\rangle$, and finally obtain an expression for $S_y$.\n",

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For spin-1/2 particle, a measurement of the projection of spin on some axis can only yield one of two outcomes, often called \"up\" and \"down\".\n",
    "- Qubits can only be measured in one of two states, often referred to as $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$.\n",
    "- We can model the Stern-Gerlach experiment on spin-1/2 particles using qubits in a quantum computer.\n",
    "- Repeated measurements of the same physical observable of the same particle/qubit will yield the same result (unless the system is perturbed by noise).\n",
    "- We can use results from the Stern-Gerlach experiment or from the analogous experiments with quantum computers to derive a system of state vectors and matrix operators that describe quantum mechanical spin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### T/F questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. T/F Starting from experimental observations, the only valid choice for a vector to represent $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$\n",
    "2. T/F If $|\\uparrow\\rangle = \\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}$, the only choice for $|\\downarrow\\rangle$ is $\\begin{pmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$ (up to a global phase).\n",
    "3. T/F A particle measured to be in the state $|0\\rangle$ will continue to be found in the state $|0\\rangle$ upon subsequent measurements along $z$.\n",
    "4. T/F A particle measured to be in the state $|0\\rangle$ will continue to be found in the state $|0\\rangle$ upon subsequent measurements along $x$.\n",
    "5. T/F A particle measured to be in the state $|0\\rangle$ will always be found in the state $|+\\rangle_x$ upon subsequent measurements along $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MC questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A particle initially in $|\\uparrow\\rangle$ has what probability of being measured in the state $|+x\\rangle$?\n",

    "    - e. None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Three friends are discussing quantum measurements and operators. Friend A says, \"Making a measurement along $z$ and acting with the operator $\\sigma_z$ are the same thing.\" Friend B says, \"Well, they are different procedures, but they have the same result.\" Friend C says, \"They are totally different; they even have different effects on most states.\" With whom do you agree and why?\n",
