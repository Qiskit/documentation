    "## The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In many calculations throughout quantum mechanics, you start with a known state of a system, and that state is typically known through a measurement. Today we want to answer the question, “What can you say about a particle's state prior to any measurement?” An obvious corollary is, “How can we know, if we're not allowed to measure?”\n",
    "\n",
    "This question dates back to the early days of quantum mechanics. Pioneers in the field fell into factions with Einstein and many others saying that a particle is simply in some unknown state prior to measurement.  Others, notably Max Born, and later Niels Bohr made a more radical claim, saying the state of a particle was truly undetermined by nature prior to measurement, not merely unknown to humans. Measurement then probabilistically collapses the particle into a definite state. Einstein, dissatisfied with this explanation, famously quipped at this, \"Gott würfelt nicht,\" which roughly translates into \"God does not play dice.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades after this disagreement emerged, many thought it might never be answered, or that it was a matter of perspective. Then, in 1964, John Bell, a physicist from Northern Ireland, wrote a paper in which he explored the statistics of certain experiments that could answer this question definitively. He showed that in a particular test, one arrives at one set of statistics from defined (but unknown) quantum states, and a different set of statistics from quantum states undetermined by nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "At that time of Bell's paper, experimental tests of the statistics involved were inaccessible to all but researchers at the very forefront of physics. But today, IBM Quantum has made it possible for students all over the world to use real quantum devices, remotely over the cloud, and for free, to explore the nature of quantum states. This is what you will do today."

    "## Setup of the thought experiment: entanglement of spin\n",
    "\n",
    "There are processes in which a particle with no spin decays into two particles that each have spin. Since spin is a kind of angular momentum, the law of conservation of angular momentum would suggest that the two outcoming particles must have spins exactly anti-aligned. Indeed this is experimentally observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example: a neutral pi meson sometimes decays into a positron and an electron:\n",
    "$$\\pi^0\\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$$\n",
    "Don’t worry if you don’t know what those particles are, and don't worry if you know them so well that you know this decay type is relatively unlikely. Just know that if one of the outcoming particles is spin up, the other must be spin down, and vice versa. Of course, there is nothing special about \"up\" and \"down\"; the same antialignment is observed if measurements are made along what we often call $x$ or $y$. This decay is a compelling context for us to consider, because we can sidestep questions about what measurements took place in the past; the positron and electron didn't even exist until the moment of decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can let $\\pi^0$ mesons decay and watch the deflection of the outcoming particles under the influence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. An inhomogeneous field used to deflect spins is often called a Stern-Gerlach device, after the researchers who first used it to (accidentally) gather evidence of the existence of quantum mechanical spin. Note that the story here is more complicated than the original experiment since the electron and positron are also charged (unlike the silver atoms in the Stern Gerlach experiment). But we know how charged particles move in a magnetic field, and we can subtract out that effect. In what follows, we will assume the deflections used in our calculations are due to the spin of the particles and not the charge. Consequently, for our purposes it doesn't matter which observer gets the positron and which gets the electron. The experimental setup is something like this:\n",

They each pass through a Stern-Gerlach device, an inhomogeneous magnetic field and measuring screen.](/learning/images/modules/quantum-mechanics/bells-inequality-with-qiskit/epr-pic.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the meson decays, an electron is kicked out in one direction, and a positron in the other. Each of these two particles will travel through an inhomogeneous magnetic field, causing it to be deflected either in the direction of the magnetic field, or opposite the magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a source of many mesons, we can collect statistics on this. If an observer on the left and one on the right (call them Lucas and Rihanna, respectively) always measure along the same axis, these statistics will not be very interesting: every time one measures up, the other measures down; every time one measures into the page, the other will measure out of the page, and so on. However, if the players are free to measure the spin along any direction they like, we may find something more interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment described above, in which particles fly off with spin angular momentum that is measured by two observers was initially proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in [this paper](https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777), and this is sometimes referred to as an \"EPR experiment\"."

    "## Our options\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us restate the two historical viewpoints, for clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Option 1__ (Einstein): The two spins (the electron and positron) are determined, in the sense that the outcome of any measurement along any axis is pre-determined by nature, even if we don't know what it is. One might think of this as the spins having some real, well-defined orientation in space, which is not known to us, but which exists. Or one might think of this as a set of information or instructions that determine outcomes of measurements along $x$, $y$, $z$, or anything in between. Measuring the spin of the positron (say along z) forces it to orient and align in the z or -z direction. This has no causal influence on the electron spin, although we know the electron spin started out opposite the positron spin, so if the positron spin is measured to be along +z, the electron spin is measured along -z. Other than the initial condition of instructions that conserve angular momentum (the spins being anti-aligned), there is no connection between the two spins. This option is sometimes called \"hidden variables\", as in: the projections along different axes are determined, but are hidden from us.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Option 2__ (Born): The spins are both undetermined in their initial states… not merely unknown, but ill-defined physically, with no definite orientation or instructions on experimental outcomes, until they are measured. Measuring the positron spin “collapses” the space of all possibilities down to a single determined state, either along the +z or -z axes. This measurement of the positron forces the electron spin to also collapse into a well-defined projection along z, exactly opposite the positron’s. This effect occurs spread out across the space between the positron and electron. This has been called \"spooky action at a distance”, but one might less-dramatically call it \"non-local physics\".\n",

    "It would be great to distinguish between the Einstein and Born options experimentally. What are some experiments that would yield the same results regardless of which option is true? Can you think of an experiment that would yield different results for the two options? **Note** It would be very impressive if you could come up with an experiment that would yield different results for Einstein's and Born's options; it took humans decades to come up with one.\n",
    "\n",
    "</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Sticking with the experiment described so far (that is, no net spin with the positron and electron anti-aligned), measurement of both spins along $\\pm x$, $\\pm y$, or $\\pm z$ would always yield opposite signs due to conservation of angular momentum, independent of which option is correct. Measuring one particle's spin (say, the electron) along one direction (say, $+z$) means the spin of the other particle, the positron, would be measured along $-z$. If instead you measure the spin of the positron along the $x$ direction, it will be equally likely to come out $+x$ or $-x$. This could be because that's what the hidden instructions say (Einstein's option 1) or because the probability distribution of the positron's spin updates after the measurement of the electron spin, and the new probability distribution is consistent with a 50-50 split between $\\pm x$ (Born's option 2). These points are explained in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is only slightly different if you consider a decay of a particle with spin-1, such that the two emerging particles (like the positron and electron) must have their spins aligned, rather than anti-aligned. If one is measured along $+y$, a measurement of the other particle along the $y$ axis must also yield $+y$, and so on. As before, this could result from either option.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this lesson is devoted to an experiment that can distinguish between Einstein and Born's options, and so we won't go into much detail here. However, part of the trick is measuring the two particles along different directions (like $x$ and $z$, or even some direction between the traditional Cartesian axes). The rest comes from carefully considering the precise probability of obtaining different outcomes given the predictions of quantum mechanics and those of classical information as in hidden variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "In either option, if the two observers, Lucas and Rihanna, measure along the same axis, we would expect them to obtain anti-aligned spins, regardless of which option is true. To see why, consider the diagrams below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Three diagrams. First there is a diagram of two spin vectors oriented in opposite directions, lying on a diagonal between the x and z axes. Next, when a measurement is made along z, one friend obtains a spin along negative z, and the other along positive z. Finally, the situation is shown for measurements along the x axis, in which case one measures a spin along negative x, and the other along positive x.](/learning/images/modules/quantum-mechanics/bells-inequality-with-qiskit/hidden-var-meas.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure above shows Einstein's option. The directions of the spins are opposite and determined. If we measure along the $z$ axis, one will be along $+z$, and one along $-z$. We have no reason to assume that the positron would be along $+z$, and the electron along $-z$; the image merely shows that the spins will be measured to be in opposite directions. In fact, a given spin need not actually have a component of its spin along the direction eventually measured, in the case of Einstein's option. The weakest statement of Einstein's option is that there is some set of instructions that are stored in the spin that determine what the measurements outcomes will be when measured along any axis. We don't need to picture that these instructions are in the form of a simple vector (see diagram below); we'll return to this, later.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Three diagrams. The first one no longer shows well-defined vector directions, but instead has a list of rules that determine the measurement outcomes. The second and third diagrams are the same as in the previous picture, showing measurements along positive/negative z, and along positive/negative x.](/learning/images/modules/quantum-mechanics/bells-inequality-with-qiskit/hidden-var-instructions.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows Born's option, in which the directions of the positron and electron spins are smeared out in a distribution of probability and have no definite direction. Don't read too much into the shape of the distribution. Each spin could actually have a non-zero probability of pointing in any direction as long as they are opposite each other; we have simply drawn them as fractions of the circle so we can visually distinguish them for discussion. Note that in the case of Born's option, it is still true that angular momentum must be conserved. So if one wave of probability is \"collapsed\" such that the spin points along $+z$, the other will point along $-z$ and be deflected in the opposite direction. The options appear identical.\n",

    "\n",
    "But what happens when observers L and R can measure along any of three axes, with each pair 120 degrees apart, as shown in Figures 4 & 5. Each observer can decide at random along what axis they will measure the spin (a, b, or c). The two do not need to measure along the same axis. When each observer measures, they might find a positive projection on their axis of choice, or they might find a negative projection. For example, Lucas and Rihanna might measure +a and -b or +b and +c. Note that if they happen to choose to measure along the same axis, then they MUST obtain opposite signs in their projections: +a and -a, +b and -b, or +c and -c; they cannot both find, for example +a. In the next section, we will work through how to calculate the probability of Lucas and Rihanna getting the same sign on their measured axes (++ or --) and opposite signs (+-) or (-+).\n",
    "\n",
    "![A diagram showing two initial spin vectors, followed by possible measurements along three lines, a, b, and c, each having a positive and negative direction. Because these axes are not mutually perpendicular, Lucas and Rihanna will not measure spins in opposite directions unless they happen to choose to measure along the same axes.](/learning/images/modules/quantum-mechanics/bells-inequality-with-qiskit/hidden-var-meas-3.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two figures above illustrate possible hidden-variables interpretations in this new, three-axis measurement scenario. That is, either the spins are already determined, as vectors, or a set of physical instructions exists somehow embedded in the system such that the outcomes of all possible measurements are pre-determined, even if they are unknowable to experimenters prior to measurement. The alternative is illustrated below. Some probability distribution of outcomes exists, and this distribution can tell us some things about the likelihood of different measurement outcomes, but the outcomes are undetermined by nature prior to measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "![A blurred out probability distribution is shown once again, now with the three new axes a, b, and c. This comes with different measurement probabilities along the various directions.](/learning/images/modules/quantum-mechanics/bells-inequality-with-qiskit/prob-dist-meas-3.avif)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can ask ourselves, “How often should the two players find the same sign of the spin’s projection?” That is, we are not even recording along which axis they chose to measure; we are simply recording whether they found the same sign or a different sign. It is not obvious whether Einstein's and Born's options will yield the same result in this more complicated measurement scheme. But it should be clear from Figures 4 and 5 that it is $possible$ for there to be a difference. For the case shown in Einstein's option, a measurement of the projection of the $e+$ spin on axis $a$ will definitely yield $+a$, and the projection of the $e-$ spin on axis $b$ will yield $-b$ (barely). But in Born's option, the possibilities are wide open. It is true that angular momentum is still conserved. But since the two magnetic fields are not oriented in along the same axis, we force the particles into a situation where they must collapse onto different axes (through interactions with the field). In the next section, we will use quantum mechanics to determine what the probabilities should be, given Born's option, that Lucas and Rihanna obtain the same sign on their measured axes (++ or --), and the probabilities that they will obtain opposite signs (+- or -+)."

    "### Step 4: Post-process and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a step back and recap: Using a hidden-variables treatment, and the 3 offset axes, we obtained a constraint on the probability for the measurements to yield the same sign $P_{same,hv} =4/9$. Then we assumed probability distributions as in quantum mechanics and obtained a __different value__ for that probability: $P_{same,gm} = 1/2$. The prediction from quantum mechanics is higher than that allowed by the hidden variables treatment. So it can be experimentally known whether quantum mechanical states are determined by nature prior to measurement, or if they are truly in a probabilistic superposition of possible states.\n",
    "\n",
    "We engineered our quantum circuits such that there are four possible outcomes corresponding to Lucas and Rihanna measuring one sign of the spin projection or the other: 00, 01, 10, and 11. In the cases of 00 and 11, Lucas and Rihanna measure the same sign, and in the cases of 01 and 10, they measure opposite signs. We see that to a very good approximation, the chance of Lucas and Rihanna getting the same sign are about 50%, definitely greater than $4/9$. This means that there is no set of hidden variables that can account for that distribution of probabilities, and the hidden-variables treatment is not compatible with experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different interpretations of quantum mechanical experimental results, and there are many subtleties to experimental setups that are revisited every so often. But so far the principles of quantum mechanics and the probabilistic interpretation of quantum states have accurately described the results. Max Born seems to have been correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take just one more moment to reflect on the significance of this. Two particles emerge from a decay event, and the two particles travel in different directions, possibly for a long time. Their spins are not in any well-defined state, and they carry no hidden-variable instructions with them to determine the outcomes of future measurements. But a measurement of one (along, say $+z$) necessarily determines the outcome of an experiment on the other particle's spin along the $z$ direction (it must be $-z$). This means that something about the physics of one particle is determined by what is done to the other particle, possibly far away. This is one situation that has led people to refer to reality as being \"non-local\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Two particles like those we've been describing are somehow \"connected\" in the sense that measurements on one can influence the other. We refer to such particles as being \"entangled\". Entanglement is more than just correlations. For example, we could construct a classical machine that spits out a magnet to one side with its north end up and a magnet to the other side with its north end down. Such magnets could be perfectly anti-correlated. But a measurement of one would do nothing to the other. In quantum mechanical entanglement, particle A could be in an undefined state (or a mixture of many states), and we can pin it down to a defined state through measurements on a totally different particle (say, B). Nothing like that exists in the classical world.\n",
    "\n",
    "This often brings up a whole new world of questions and possibilities. Some of the ideas it conjures are real, like using entanglement to compute, as in quantum computers! Some are deceptively appealing, but turn out to fail, like trying to use entanglement to send information faster than light. We encourage you ask all the questions occurring to you, and read about how others have investigated these phenomena. There is a whole world of quantum mechanics out there to explore, but here are just a few resources you might check out:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Friends A, B, and C are discussing results from this lab, related to Bell's Inequality. Specifically, they are looking at the image that shows the quantum mechanical probability of measuring the same sign along axes is greater than that allowed by a hidden-variables treatment: $(P_\\text{same})_\\text{max,QM}>(P_\\text{same})_\\text{max,HV}$. Friend A says, \"This means that we didn't know the spin states prior to a measurement.\" Friend B says, \"No, it's more than that. This means the spins are not already pointing in a particular direction, prior to measurement. Although, the spin state might somehow be determined or stored somehow\" Friend C says, \"No, it's even more than that. This means the future spin state wasn't even decided by nature prior to measurement.\" With whom do you agree, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain how quantum mechanical phenomena like entanglement indicate that reality is non-local.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What additional experiments would you like to do to convince yourself of the results obtained here?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Could Bell's inequality only be explored with 3 equally-spaced axes $a$, $b$, and $c$? Could it be done with any other number of axes? What would this look like? Would it still yield a difference in probabilities predicted by hidden variables vs. probabilistic quantum mechanics?"
