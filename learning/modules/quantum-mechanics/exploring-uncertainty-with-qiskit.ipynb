    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You have probably heard of the uncertainty principle, even outside of your physics courses. A common colloquial restatement of uncertainty is \"By looking at something, you influence it.\" That is certainly true. But a more physical way of describing uncertainty is that there are certain physical observables that have an incompatibility that prevents them both from being simultaneously known to arbitrary accuracy. Many students first encounter the pair of incompatible variables $x$ and $p_x$, meaning the position along one axis called the $x$-axis, and the linear momentum along that direction, respectively. For those variables the constraint on uncertainty is written\n",
    "$$\\Delta x \\Delta p_x \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}.$$\n",
    "Here, $\\Delta x$ is called the \"uncertainty in $x$\", which has the same definition as standard deviation in statistics, and can be defined as\n",
    "$$\\Delta x = \\sqrt{\\langle x^2 \\rangle - \\langle x \\rangle^2}.$$\n",
    "$\\Delta p_x$ is defined in the same way.\n",
    "Here, we will not derive this uncertainty relation; we will point out that it is consistent with our understanding of classical waves. That is, a wave with truly one perfect frequency $f$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ would go on and on forever as a perfect sinusoid. Quantum mechanically, this would correspond to knowing the momentum perfectly according to de Broglie's hypothesis: $\\lambda = h/p$. But in order to know $where$ a wave-like particle is located, the wave describing it must become more sharply peaked in space, like a very narrow Gaussian, for example. We know that we can express any continuous function, including such sharply-peaked wave functions, as a Fourier series of sinusoidal functions with different wavelengths. But as the wave function becomes more sharply peaked (and the position is better known), we will require more terms in the Fourier series, meaning a mixture of more wavelengths (and thus, quantum mechanically, more values of momentum).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stated more simply: a state with a well-defined momentum (a perfect sinusoid in space) has very uncertain position. A state with a well-defined position (like a Dirac delta distribution) has a very uncertain momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other variables that exhibit such incompatibility. For example, a particle's spin may have a well-defined projection along one axis, but then we know nothing about the project on an orthogonal axis. For example the state $|0\\rangle \\sim |\\uparrow\\rangle$ (for a qubit or spin-1/2 particle) has a definite projection along the $z$ axis (of 1 in the context of a qubit, and of $\\hbar/2$ in the context of a spin-1/2 particle). But this state can be written as a superposition of two states each of which has a well-defined projection onto the $x$ axis:\n",
    "$$|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|+\\rangle_x+|-\\rangle_x)$$\n",
    "or equivalently\n",
    "$$\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1\\end{pmatrix}\\right].$$\n",
    "$|+\\rangle_x$ has a well-defined projection onto $x$, as does $|-\\rangle_x$. So if we specify the projection of a state along the $x$ axis, we do not know the projection along the $z$ axis. And if we specify the projection on the $z$ axis, we don't know the projection along $x$. There are minor differences when discussing this in the context of spin and in qubits. But generally speaking, eigenstates of the Pauli matrices have an interesting relationship that we can explore.\n",
    "Throughout this lesson, we will be experimentally checking our intuition for the uncertainty in these incompatible variables, and verifying that uncertainty relations hold on IBM&reg; quantum computers."

Previously, we at least knew what the outcome would be of the first measurement, now we have a fairly even distribution across all possible states. It's not too hard to see why this happened.

    "So clearly there should be equal probability of obtaining the + or - state (mapped to 0 and 1 in the chart) for the first measurement. The measurement along $x$ collapses the state into either an eigenstate $|+\\rangle_x$ or the eigenstate $|-\\rangle_x$.

    "So once the system is in an eigenstate of $x$, clearly, measurements along $z$ will yield both $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, and will do so with roughly equal probability.\n",
    "So our first example showed us that some states will have very predictable outcomes of some measurements, but unpredictable outcomes for other measurements. The current example shows us that we can do worse than that. There are states that can give us unpredictable outcomes for both measurements, even if all we do is swap the order of the measurements. Let's investigate how certain or uncertain a quantity is for a given state."

    "\n",
    "- There are uncertainty relations between many sets of physical observables, including position & linear momentum, and components of spin.\n",
    "- The Pauli matrices do not commute. This is a mathematical reflection of the fact that not all components of spin can be simultaneously known/determined.\n",
    "- Quantum computing makes heavy use of the Pauli operators/matrices, so it is useful to know the uncertainty relation for Pauli operators, as well as the closely-related spin operators.\n",
    "- A general formula for the uncertainty of two operators $A$ and $B$ is $$\\Delta A \\Delta B \\geq \\frac{1}{2}|\\langle [A,B] \\rangle|.$$\n",
    "- An eigenstate $|a\\rangle$ of some operator $A$ yields zero uncertainty in the physical observable associated with that operator. Even experimentally, $\\langle a|A|a\\rangle \\approx 0.$\n",
    "- An eigenstate $|a\\rangle$ of some operator $A$ will yield a larger uncertainty for an operator $B$ that does not commute with $A$.\n",
    "- Experimental results using a real quantum computer confirm the intuition we gain from matrix representations of physical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### T/F Questions:\n",
    "\n",

    "2. T/F One can simultaneously measure $X$ and $Z$, but not $Y$.\n",
    "3. T/F Linear position and linear momentum operators do not commute.\n",
    "4. T/F IBM quantum computers measure along $Z$ by default, so a rotation must be performed to measure along any other direction.\n",

    "1. Does this concept of uncertainty conflict in any way with the notion of spin as a vector arrow in Cartesian space? How about on the Bloch sphere?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Suppose you orient a measurement device along a direction half-way between the $x$ and $y$ axes. What happens? Can you make a measurement along this direction? How does this relate to uncertainty in $X$ and $Y$?\n",

    "3. What additional experiments would you like to do to convince yourself of the results obtained here?"
